 a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported 
 the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said 
 <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N 
 although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem 
 a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story 
 we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties 
 there is no asbestos in our products now 
 neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes 
 we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute 
 dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university 
 the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N 
 from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said 
 among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number 
 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer 
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said 
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk> 
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said 
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters 
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said 
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine 
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained 
 in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos 
 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed 
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s 
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used 
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters 
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area 
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk> 
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago 
 it has no bearing on our work force today

 john rowe president and chief executive officer of new england electric said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to ps of new hampshire such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating <unk> did n't come true 
 when we <unk> raising our bid the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years and the rewards seemed a long way out 
 that got hard to take he added 
 mr. rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric 
 no matter who owns ps of new hampshire after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation he said 
 that attracts attention 
 it was just another one of the risk factors that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding he added 
 wilbur ross jr. of rothschild inc. the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders said the withdrawal of new england electric might speed up the reorganization process 
 the fact that new england proposed lower rate increases N N over seven years against around N N boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders complicated negotiations with state officials mr. ross asserted

 commonwealth edison co. was ordered to refund about $ N million to its current and former <unk> for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant 
 the refund was about $ N million more than previously ordered by the illinois commerce commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility 
 state court judge richard curry ordered edison to make average refunds of about $ N to $ N each to edison customers who have received electric service since april N including about two million customers who have moved during that period 
 judge curry ordered the refunds to begin feb. N and said that he would n't <unk> any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison 
 the refund pool may not be held <unk> through another round of appeals judge curry said 
 commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order 
 the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual <unk> made until dec. N of this year 
 commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its N earnings by $ N a share

 the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any <unk> expenses 
 the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its N million customers subject to a refund since N 
 in august the commission ruled that between $ N million and $ N million of the plant 's construction cost was <unk> and should be <unk> plus interest

 the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and <unk> of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray 
 not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet 
 documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ N million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the <unk> project he heads is scrapped 
 the documents also said that although the <unk> mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype 
 moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects 
 while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> cray research first announced the spinoff in may the <unk> it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday 
 we did n't have much of a choice cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory <unk> said in an interview 
 the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed 
 cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour 
 the documents also said that cray computer anticipates <unk> perhaps another $ N million in financing beginning next september 
 but mr. <unk> called that a <unk> scenario 
 the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ N yesterday to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ N million <unk> note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company 
 it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said gary p. <unk> of <unk> group inc. minneapolis 
 cray computer will be a concept stock he said 
 you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't 
 besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky <unk> chip technology 
 the sec documents describe those chips which are made of <unk> <unk> as being so fragile and minute they will require special <unk> handling equipment 
 in addition the cray-3 will contain N processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer 
 cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about N N of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in N 
 the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd 
 the new company said it believes there are fewer than N potential customers for <unk> priced between $ N million and $ N million presumably the cray-3 price range 
 under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks 
 no price for the new shares has been set 
 instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide 
 cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq 
 analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ N a share 
 along with the note cray research is <unk> about $ N million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings 
 <unk> balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff 
 without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ N million for the first half of N rather than the $ N million it posted 
 on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ N million loss 
 mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research 
 regarded as the father of the supercomputer mr. cray was paid $ N at cray research last year 
 at cray computer he will be paid $ N 
 besides messrs. cray and <unk> other senior management at the company includes neil <unk> N president and chief executive officer joseph m. <unk> N vice president engineering malcolm a. <unk> N vice president software and douglas r. <unk> N vice president hardware

 they will remain on a <unk> list that includes N other countries 
 those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose <unk> problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list 
 gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in <unk> cases said the threat of u.s. <unk> combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia 
 what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working he said 
 he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law 
 mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia

 earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ N million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund 
 that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank 
 the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co 
 the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors 
 first they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline and such prepayment forces investors to <unk> their money at lower rates 
 second they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments reducing the administrative burden on investors 
 by addressing those problems mr. maxwell said the new funds have become extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s. 
 such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than N N of the $ N billion in such instruments outstanding and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate 
 they also have become large purchasers of fannie mae 's corporate debt buying $ N billion in fannie mae bonds during the first nine months of the year or almost a <unk> of the total amount issued

 italian chemical giant montedison <unk> through its montedison acquisition n.v. indirect unit began its $ <unk> tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of erbamont n.v. a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the netherlands 
 the offer advertised in today 's editions of the wall street journal is scheduled to expire at the end of november 
 montedison currently owns about N N of erbamont 's common shares outstanding 
 the offer is being launched <unk> to a previously announced agreement between the companies 
 japan 's reserves of gold convertible foreign currencies and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ N billion in october to $ N billion the finance ministry said 
 the total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline 
 the <unk> downturn reflects the intensity of bank of japan <unk> intervention since june when the u.s. currency temporarily surged above the N yen level 
 the announcement follows a sharper $ N billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in september to $ N billion 
 pick a country any country 
 it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall street a rash of new closed-end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country 
 no fewer than N country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of N according to charles e. simon & co. a washington-based research firm 
 the turf recently has ranged from chile to <unk> to portugal 
 next week the philippine fund 's launch will be capped by a visit by philippine president <unk> aquino the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the big board here

 anything 's possible how about the new guinea fund <unk> george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates of <unk> mass 
 the recent explosion of country funds <unk> the closed-end fund mania of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular 
 they fell into <unk> after the N crash 
 unlike traditional <unk> mutual funds most of these <unk> portfolios are the closed-end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly 
 the surge brings to nearly N the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london 
 these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets 
 people are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham & co. new york 
 behind all the <unk> is some <unk> competition 
 as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell 
 and the firms are stretching their <unk> far and wide to do it 
 financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a <unk> of international securities 
 and many emerging markets have <unk> more mature markets such as the u.s. and japan 
 country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies 
 but it does n't take much to get burned 
 political and currency gyrations can <unk> the funds 
 another concern the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market 
 when the stock market dropped nearly N N oct. N for instance the mexico fund plunged about N N and the spain fund fell N N 
 and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the N crash 
 what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios 
 after trading at an average discount of more than N N in late N and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of N N 
 the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold 
 it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say 
 but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling N N premium 
 it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to N 's european economic integration 
 and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums 
 i 'm very alarmed to see these rich <unk> says smith barney 's mr. porter 
 the newly <unk> premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests 
 unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking <unk> exposure may be less <unk> to paying higher prices for country funds 
 there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here mr. porter says 
 nonetheless plenty of u.s. analysts and money managers are <unk> at the <unk> trading levels of some country funds 
 they argue that u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s. 
 that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium 
 for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <unk> 's mr. foot says the only advice i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly 
 the u.s. and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ N million in <unk> russian debts owed to the u.s. government the state department said 
 if the debts are repaid it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u.s. 
 however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it 's too early to say whether that will happen 
 <unk> with the talks the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch 
 the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved last spring and opened in july 
 but a soviet bank here would be <unk> unless moscow found a way to settle the $ N million debt which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic <unk> government before the communists seized power in N 
 under a N law the johnson debt default act as amended it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund 
 the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization 
 moscow has settled <unk> debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value 
 the state department stressed the <unk> debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act 
 but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii <unk> program 
 in another reflection that the growth of the economy is <unk> off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in september 
 meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month 
 its index inched up to N N in october from N N in september 
 any reading below N N suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining 
 the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline 
 factories booked $ N billion in orders in september nearly the same as the $ N billion in august the commerce department said 
 if not for a N N surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen N N 
 in a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ N billion not significantly different from the $ N billion reported for august 
 private construction spending was down but government building activity was up 
 the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation 
 kenneth <unk> economist for society corp. a cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to <unk> off 
 at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry 
 what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked 
 i draw a blank 
 by most measures the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all 
 factory <unk> fell in september 
 so did the federal reserve board 's <unk> index 
 yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession 
 they cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn 
 inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance 
 economists say a buildup in inventories can <unk> cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession 
 but yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell N N in september the first decline since february N 
 this <unk> to the soft landing scenario said elliott <unk> an economist at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive 
 a soft landing is an economic slowdown that <unk> inflation without leading to a recession 
 the department said orders for <unk> goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell N N in september to $ N billion after climbing N N the month before 
 orders for durable goods were up N N to $ N billion after rising N N the month before 
 the department previously estimated that <unk> orders fell N N in september 
 factory shipments fell N N to $ N billion after rising N N in august 
 shipments have been relatively level since january the commerce department noted 
 manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose N N in september to $ N billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector 
 excluding these orders backlogs declined N N 
 in its construction spending report the commerce department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off N N in september to an annual rate of $ N billion 
 david <unk> economist for the mortgage bankers association predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes but probably not until early next year 
 spending on private <unk> construction was off N N to an annual rate of $ N billion with no sector showing strength 
 government construction spending rose N N to $ N billion 
 after adjusting for inflation the commerce department said construction spending did n't change in september 
 for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about N N above last year 's level 
 the government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's <unk> dodge group 
 dodge reported an N N increase in construction contracts awarded in september 
 the <unk> counts money as it is spent dodge counts contracts when they are awarded 
 the government includes money spent on residential <unk> dodge does n't 
 although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't <unk> an imminent recession said robert <unk> chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes inc. stamford conn 
 he said the index would have to be in the low N N range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession 
 the report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth though still continuing may be slowing 
 only N N of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october down from N N in september 
 and N N said export orders were down last month compared with N N the month before 
 the <unk> managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control 
 for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell 
 the decline was even <unk> than in september 
 they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months 
 economists consider that a sign that <unk> pressures are <unk> 
 when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times <unk> prices tend to rise 
 the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than N purchasing executives 
 each of the survey 's indicators <unk> the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening 
 for the first time the october survey polled members on imports 
 it found that of the N N who import N N said they imported more in october and N N said they imported less than the previous month 
 while acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend mr. <unk> said it does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much 
 items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one <unk> milk and milk <unk> 
 it 's an odd thing to put on the list mr. <unk> noted 
 he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of <unk> dry milk 
 they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas

 it 's probably true that many <unk> put in <unk> overtime just for the <unk> of solidarity that the system is so <unk> that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager and that sony was <unk> of letting a young short-term american employee take on any responsibility 
 all of this must have been <unk> frustrating to mr. <unk> who went to sony with degrees in business and computer science and was <unk> to <unk> another <unk>

 this is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event 
 the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign has come of age in an <unk> election year with only a few <unk> scattered across the country 
 but in the three leading political <unk> of N the negative ads have reached new levels of <unk> raising fears that this kind of <unk> empty of significant issues is <unk> in a new era of campaigns without content 
 now says joseph <unk> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always 
 a trend that started with the first <unk> of politics accelerated with the <unk> of the television age and became a <unk> art form in N has reached an entirely new stage 
 to get people 's attention these days says douglas <unk> a political consultant your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means <unk> 
 and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is <unk> 
 in N as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves 
 take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday 's elections in new york city new jersey and virginia 
 new york city 
 the screen <unk> with a small tight <unk> shot of david dinkins democratic candidate for mayor of new york city 
 david dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a <unk> male voice 
 and then this television commercial paid for by republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger <unk> the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business 
 mr. dinkins the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately <unk> his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted <unk> through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office 
 david dinkins says the <unk> why does he always wait until he 's caught 
 nasty <unk> says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director designed to <unk> a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist 
 <unk> by the giuliani ads mr. dinkins 's tv consultants robert <unk> and david <unk> finally <unk> a negative ad of their own 
 the screen shows two distorted <unk> photos presumably of two politicians 
 compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer 
 one says he 's for banning <unk> bullets 
 the other has opposed a ban on <unk> bullets 
 one claims he 's pro-choice 
 the other has opposed a woman 's right to choose 
 funny thing says the <unk> both these candidates are named rudolph giuliani 
 who 's telling the truth 
 everybody and nobody 
 it 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate 
 mr. dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job 
 he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it 
 the city 's campaign finance board has refused to pay mr. dinkins $ N in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete 
 the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors 
 and says mr. dinkins he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a <unk> effort had been convicted of <unk> 
 but say mr. dinkins 's managers he did have an office and his organization did have members 
 mr. giuliani 's campaign chairman peter powers says the dinkins ad is deceptive 
 the other side he argues knows giuliani has always been pro-choice even though he has personal reservations 
 they know he is generally opposed to <unk> bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation 
 virginia 
 democratic <unk> gov. douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank <unk> that analysts of every political <unk> agree was a tour de force 
 against a shot of <unk> <unk> on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that <unk> have <unk> for generations 
 then just as an image of the <unk> of thomas jefferson <unk> from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians 
 that commercial which said mr. coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the campaign <unk> it at least in part into a <unk> on abortion 
 the ad prompted mr. coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed to shake mr. wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad 
 the coleman <unk> featured a <unk> of a young woman in <unk> and the ad suggested that she was <unk> an <unk> courtroom <unk> 
 a voice says <unk> now do n't you have <unk> 
 then an announcer <unk> it was douglas wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age N and younger to be <unk> about their private lives by lawyers for accused <unk> 
 so the next time mr. wilder talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he tried to pass 
 mr. wilder did introduce such legislation N years ago but he did so at the request of a <unk> a common legislative technique used by lawmakers 
 the legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request and in N mr. wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from <unk> <unk> 
 people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the <unk> of being a negative <unk> says mark <unk> a political scientist at mary washington college 
 wilder has managed to get across the idea that coleman will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the <unk> for all the negative <unk> on coleman 
 mr. coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive <unk> but the truce lasted only hours 
 by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr. coleman himself raising questions about mr. wilder 's <unk> to rape victims 
 new jersey 
 the attacks began when democratic rep. james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of <unk> and a photograph of mr. florio 's rival republican rep. jim courter 
 remember <unk> says a female voice 
 consider jim courter 
 and then this commercial produced by bob <unk> gets down to its own mean and <unk> business 
 pictures of <unk> oil <unk> <unk> into focus and the female voice <unk> that hazardous waste on his mr. courter 's property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud 
 and the nose on mr. courter 's face grows 
 the only fraud involved cry mr. courter 's <unk> is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own <unk> commercial produced by mr. <unk> 
 in this one the screen <unk> with photographs of both candidates 
 who 's really lying asks a female voice 
 florio 's lying the voice goes on because the barrel on courter 's land contained heating oil was <unk> up and caused no pollution 
 mr. courter 's long nose <unk> while mr. florio 's grows 
 who 's telling the truth 
 stephen <unk> a political scientist at new jersey 's <unk> institute says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate 
 barrels were dumped on the courter property a complaint was made but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment 
 even so according to mr. <unk> the ad was devastating because it raised questions about mr. courter 's credibility 
 but it 's building on a long tradition 
 in N on route to a re-election rout of democrat frank <unk> gop gov. nelson rockefeller of new york appeared in person saying if you want to keep the crime rates high <unk> is your man

 japanese investment in southeast asia is <unk> the region toward economic integration 
 interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades 
 but japan 's power in the region also is <unk> fears of domination and <unk> fresh policy questions 
 the flow of japanese funds has set in motion a process <unk> these economies will be <unk> together by the great japanese investment machine says robert <unk> vice chairman of goldman sachs international corp 
 in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ N billion 
 in thailand for example the government 's board of investment approved $ N million of japanese investment in N N times the u.s. investment figure for the year 
 japan 's commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade 
 asia 's other <unk> countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region 
 in taiwan and south korea rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for <unk> production 
 these nations known as asia 's little <unk> also are contributing to southeast asia 's integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan 's 
 for <unk> countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth 
 but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic <unk> now 
 because of budget constraints in washington the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region 
 but it <unk> yielding political ground 
 in the coming decade analysts say <unk> relations will be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic <unk> 
 japan 's swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution 
 in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export 
 in the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into <unk> with plants around the world 
 to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business 
 these nations ' internal decisions will be made in a way not to <unk> their largest aid <unk> largest private investor and largest lender says richard <unk> director of the international business and research program at the university of southern california 's graduate school of business 
 japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more <unk> economic region 
 but analysts say asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the european common market approach 
 rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says kent <unk> a specialist in east asian economies at the <unk> wilson school for public and <unk> affairs at princeton university 
 in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture <unk> in japan <unk> the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia 
 the effect will be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says goldman sachs 's mr. <unk> 
 countries in the region also are beginning to consider a <unk> for closer economic and political ties 
 the economic and foreign ministers of N asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications 
 participants will include the u.s. australia canada japan south korea and new zealand as well as the six members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the philippines and <unk> 
 in addition the u.s. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the pacific <unk> in a major speech by secretary of state james baker following up a proposal made in january by australian prime minister bob <unk> 
 the baker proposal <unk> washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region 
 in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape mr. baker said 
 the u.s. with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture 
 but maintaining u.s. influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region 
 japan not only <unk> the u.s. in investment flows but also <unk> it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia 
 moreover the japanese government now the world 's largest aid <unk> is pumping far more assistance into the region than the u.s. is 
 while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's <unk> role in asia they also convey an <unk> of caution 
 there 's an understanding on the part of the u.s. that japan has to expand its functions in asia says j. michael <unk> undersecretary of commerce for trade 
 if they approach it with a <unk> <unk> attitude there will be a net gain for everyone 
 some asian nations are <unk> about washington 's demand that tokyo step up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region 
 the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south korea 
 many <unk> regard a u.s. presence as a desirable <unk> to japanese influence 
 no one wants the u.s. to pick up its <unk> and go home mr. <unk> says 
 for their part taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese <unk> 
 they do n't want japan to <unk> the region and <unk> it up says <unk> lee professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania 
 <unk> rice could hardly believe her eyes 
 while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth <unk> at greenville high school last march N she spotted a student looking at <unk> sheets 
 she had seen cheating before but these notes were <unk> 
 a <unk> is an example of a profession in trade and finance 
 at the end of world war ii germany surrendered before japan 
 the <unk> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms 
 virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the <unk> section of the test the student was taking 
 in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the N questions in that section 
 the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest 
 my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test he said 
 the teacher in question was nancy yeargin considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school 
 confronted mrs. yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two <unk> geography classes 
 she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead <unk> and <unk> the answers 
 mrs. yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security 
 in september she pleaded guilty and paid a $ N fine 
 her alternative was N days in jail 
 her story is partly one of personal <unk> 
 she was an <unk> teacher who won <unk> and inspired students but she will probably never teach again 
 in her wake she left the <unk> and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a <unk> of colleagues who say she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated <unk> and of <unk> officials stunned that despite the <unk> nature of her actions she became something of a local <unk> 
 mrs. yeargin 's case also <unk> some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where <unk> testing has enhanced the temptation to <unk> 
 the N statute mrs. yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina 's <unk> laws 
 prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's N education improvement act 
 the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher <unk> scores 
 there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says walt <unk> an education professor and testing specialist at boston college 
 so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise 
 and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing 
 a <unk> study released in september by friends for education an <unk> n.m. <unk> group concluded that outright cheating by american educators is common 
 the group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as mrs. yeargin did although most are never caught 
 evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so 
 california 's education department suspects adult responsibility for <unk> at N schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test 
 after numerous <unk> of questionable teacher help to students texas is <unk> its security practices 
 and sales of <unk> booklets for classroom instruction are booming 
 these materials including <unk> school publishing co. 's scoring high and learning materials are nothing short of sophisticated <unk> sheets according to some recent academic research 
 by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students <unk> the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers 
 use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county mrs. yeargin 's school district 
 experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina 
 under the state 's education improvement act low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into <unk> <unk> <unk> that can mean <unk> 
 high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the <unk> 
 and south carolina says it is getting results 
 since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <unk> <unk> test than south carolina although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about N states who use the sat as the primary college <unk> examination 
 critics say south carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much 
 friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating 
 says the organization 's founder john <unk> <unk> mrs. yeargin is a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all 
 paul <unk> director of testing for the south carolina department of education says mr. <unk> 's allegations of cheating are <unk> without foundation and based on unfair <unk> 
 partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of <unk> preparation booklets next spring 
 south carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school 
 standing on a <unk> hill in a <unk> area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south carolina 's best and <unk> including the state 's last two governors nobel prize winning <unk> charles <unk> and actress <unk> <unk> 
 but by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad <unk> 
 it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says linda ward the school 's principal 
 crime was awful test scores were low and there was no <unk> in <unk> programs 
 mrs. ward took over in N becoming the school 's seventh principal in N years 
 her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown 
 prior to his term a teacher <unk> to death in the halls <unk> by a student 
 <unk> mrs. ward says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two <unk> and evenly split student groups a <unk> white elite from old <unk> neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from <unk> inner city neighborhoods 
 mrs. ward resolved to clean out <unk> in the school 's faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf 
 one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and <unk> in a new public spirit for school <unk> 
 another was nancy yeargin who came to greenville in N full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward 
 being a teacher just became my life says the <unk> mrs. yeargin a teacher for N years before her dismissal 
 i loved the school its history 
 i even <unk> about school and new things to do with my students 
 while mrs. ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve <unk> mrs. yeargin worked <unk> days and fast became a student favorite 
 in N and N she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law 
 encouraged by mrs. ward mrs. yeargin taught honor students in the state teacher <unk> program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career 
 she won grant money for the school advised <unk> ran the <unk> club proposed and taught a new cultural <unk> class in western <unk> and was chosen by the school <unk> as teacher of the year 
 she was an <unk> lady she had it all together says <unk> <unk> a freshman at the university of south carolina who had mrs. yeargin in the <unk> class last year 
 she says that because of mrs. yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher 
 mary beth <unk> a greenville <unk> <unk> also says mrs. yeargin inspired her to go into education 
 she taught us more in western <unk> than i 've ever learned in other classes says <unk> green a greenville senior 
 in the classroom students say mrs. yeargin distinguished herself by <unk> teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using <unk> type <unk> 
 on <unk> she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom 
 she just never gave it up says mary <unk> mary beth 's mother 
 you 'd see her <unk> <unk> in the stands at a football game 
 some fellow teachers however viewed mrs. yeargin as <unk> and too yielding to students 
 mrs. ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a <unk> 
 pressures began to build 
 friends told her she was pushing too hard 
 because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer 
 mrs. yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's <unk> program 
 but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests 
 huge gains by her students in N and N meant a total of $ N in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ N 
 winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her mrs. yeargin insists 
 but others at greenville high say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition 
 mary elizabeth <unk> another <unk> teacher says she believed mrs. yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing 
 indeed mrs. yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher <unk> program 
 last march after attending a teaching <unk> in washington mrs. yeargin says she returned to greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her <unk> geography students adequately 
 when test booklets were passed out N hours ahead of time she says she <unk> questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students 
 mrs. yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her <unk> were correct 
 i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says 
 only five of the N questions were geography questions 
 the rest were history <unk> finance subjects they never had 
 mrs. yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift greenville high school 's overall test scores usually near the bottom of N district high schools in <unk> carried annually by local newspapers 
 mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to <unk> that her <unk> students would suffer from doing badly on the test 
 these kids broke my heart she says 
 a whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive 
 they desperately needed somebody who showed they <unk> for them who loved them 
 the last thing they needed was another <unk> blow 
 school officials and prosecutors say mrs. yeargin is lying 
 they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly 
 that pretty much <unk> any <unk> that she was out to help the poor <unk> child says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of greenville high school 's <unk> association 
 mrs. yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding i wanted to help all students 
 mr. watson says mrs. yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair 
 do i have much <unk> for her mr. watson asks 
 not really 
 i believe in the system 
 i believe you have to use the system to change it 
 what she did was like taking the law into your own hands 
 mrs. ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the <unk> public disclosure that a trial would bring 
 she says she offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate 
 mrs. yeargin declined 
 she said something like you just want to make it easy for the school 
 i was <unk> mrs. ward recalls 
 it was like someone had turned a <unk> in me 
 to the <unk> and <unk> of her <unk> and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the <unk> of standardized tests <unk> yeargin won widespread local support 
 the <unk> hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf 
 supportive callers <unk> unfair testing not mrs. yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared 
 the show did n't give the <unk> of mrs. yeargin 's <unk> saying only that she helped students do better on the test 
 the message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our <unk> and our testing policies in this state said the <unk> host 
 <unk> in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs. yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being <unk> 
 the radio show <unk> us says mrs. ward 
 partly because of the show mr. watson says the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have <unk> the charges and the conviction from her record 
 and legal authorities <unk> up an investigation worthy of a murder case 
 over N witnesses mostly students were interviewed 
 at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the <unk> <unk> were crushed 
 it 's hard to explain to a <unk> why someone they like had to go says mrs. ward 
 soon <unk> appeared in the <unk> that carried the school 's familiar <unk> <unk> <unk> on the front 
 on the back the shirts read we have all the answers 
 many colleagues are angry at mrs. yeargin 
 she did a lot of harm says <unk> rice who had discovered the <unk> notes 
 we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair <unk> on all of us 
 but several teachers also say the incident <unk> doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores 
 says <unk> key a <unk> teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of <unk> 
 there may be others doing what she did 
 mrs. yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win <unk> and because she was afraid of further charges 
 mrs. ward for one was relieved 
 despite the strong evidence against mrs. yeargin popular sentiment was so strong in her favor mrs. ward says that i 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her 
 since <unk> first touched slate <unk> have wanted to know what 's on the test 
 these days students can often find the answer in <unk> <unk> and <unk> their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests 
 the <unk> section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth <unk> what is another name for the roman <unk> <unk> 
 it also asks them to add <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> in a <unk> <unk> called learning materials sold to schools across the country by <unk> school publishing co. contain the same questions 
 in many other <unk> there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials 
 what 's more the test and learning materials are both produced by the same company <unk> a joint venture of mcgraw-hill inc. and macmillan 's parent britain 's maxwell communication corp 
 close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say 
 <unk> booklets software and <unk> are a booming publishing <unk> 
 but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of <unk> cheating 
 if i took these preparation booklets into my classroom i 'd have a hard time <unk> to my students and parents that it was n't cheating says john <unk> a <unk> city mich. teacher who has studied test <unk> 
 he and other critics say such <unk> aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress 
 it 's as if france decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody <unk> the test they say their kids are good in european history says john <unk> an <unk> n.m. <unk> and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which has studied standardized testing 
 standardized achievement tests are given about N million times a year across the country to students generally from <unk> through eighth grade 
 the most widely used of these tests are <unk> 's cat and comprehensive test of basic skills the iowa test of basic skills by <unk> <unk> co. and <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's metropolitan achievement test and stanford achievement test 
 sales figures of the <unk> materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant 
 in arizona california florida louisiana maryland new jersey south carolina and texas educators say they are common classroom tools 
 <unk> says well over N million of its scoring high <unk> books have been sold since their introduction N years ago with most sales in the last five years 
 about N sets of learning materials teachers ' <unk> have also been sold in the past four years 
 the materials in each set reach about N students 
 scoring high and learning materials are the <unk> preparation tests 
 michael kean director of marketing for <unk> <unk> the <unk> division that publishes learning materials says it is n't aimed at improving test scores 
 he also asserted that exact questions were n't <unk> 
 when referred to the questions that matched he said it was <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> and william <unk> a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test 
 they devised a <unk> scale <unk> one point for each <unk> measured on the cat test to rate the <unk> of test <unk> to the <unk> cat 
 because many of these <unk> the <unk> of <unk> figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar <unk> for example are only a small part of the total <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> says the preparation <unk> would n't <unk> too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general <unk> with test procedures 
 but learning materials matched on N of N <unk> 
 scoring high matched on N 
 in cat sections where students ' knowledge of <unk> <unk> sounds is tested the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth <unk> should know 
 learning materials for the <unk> contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items 
 rick <unk> senior editor of scoring high says that messrs. <unk> and <unk> are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format 
 he said authors of scoring high <unk> avoid <unk> exact questions but he does n't deny that some items are similar 
 when scoring high first came out in N it was a publication of random house 
 mcgraw-hill was <unk> 
 in a N advisory to educators mcgraw-hill said scoring high should n't be used because it represented a parallel form of the cat and <unk> tests 
 but in N mcgraw-hill purchased the random house unit that publishes scoring high which later became part of <unk> 
 messrs. <unk> and kean say they are <unk> of any efforts by mcgraw-hill to modify or <unk> scoring high 
 <unk> corp. said it completed the acquisition of sacramento savings & loan association from the <unk> & <unk> c. <unk> foundation for $ N million

 the department of health and human services plans to extend its <unk> on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants 
 medical researchers believe the <unk> of small amounts of <unk> tissue into humans could help treat <unk> <unk> and such <unk> diseases as <unk> 's <unk> 's and <unk> 's 
 but anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of <unk> using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions 
 james mason assistant secretary for health said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely 
 he said the ban wo n't stop privately funded <unk> research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants 
 department officials say that hhs secretary louis sullivan will support dr. mason 's ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the national institutes of health 
 both dr. mason and dr. sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion as does president bush except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened 
 the controversy began in N when the national institutes of health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an hhs review of its plan to <unk> <unk> tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from <unk> 's disease 
 the department placed a <unk> on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues 
 a majority of an <unk> panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became <unk> in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding 
 the dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the nih and the centers for disease control 
 several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants 
 antonio novello whom mr. bush <unk> to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion 
 dr. novello is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development 
 some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts 
 earlier this week dr. sullivan tried to <unk> these charges by stressing that candidates to head the nih and the <unk> will be <unk> by standards of scientific and administrative <unk> not politics 
 but the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue <unk> many scientists 
 when scientific progress moves into <unk> ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications says <unk> <unk> associate dean of the yale medical school 
 the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become <unk> so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground 
 yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants 
 but dr. <unk> warns that dr. mason 's ruling may discourage private funding 
 the <unk> of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said 
 despite the <unk> over transplants federal funding of research involving <unk> <unk> will continue on a number of fronts 
 such research may ultimately result in the ability to <unk> damaged <unk> or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause down 's syndrome the leading cause of mental <unk> according to an nih summary 
 the nih currently spends about $ N million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ N billion

 the internal revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ N in cash 
 the warnings issued to at least N criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by <unk> privilege 
 the irs warnings stem from a N law that requires anyone who receives more than $ N in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as form N 
 the form asks for such details as the client 's name social security number <unk> number and details about the services provided for the payment 
 failure to complete the form had been punishable as a <unk> until last november when congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to N years in prison 
 attorneys have argued since N when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their <unk> to be known 
 many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent years citing <unk> privilege 
 until last week the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms 
 this form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client said neal r. <unk> president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers 
 the irs is asking lawyers to <unk> a criminal problem to the government added mr. <unk> a miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the <unk> irs forms sent by certified mail 
 mr. <unk> said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts 
 these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers 
 mr. <unk> said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers 
 filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action against the clients he said 
 the defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week <unk> by new york attorney gerald <unk> to deal with the matter 
 the american bar association 's house of delegates passed a resolution in N <unk> the irs reporting requirement 
 michael ross a new york lawyer who heads the aba 's grand jury committee said that lawyers are prohibited by the aba 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death 
 mr. ross said he met with officials of the irs and the justice department which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers to discuss the issue last may 
 at that meeting he said the justice department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice 
 mr. ross said irs officials opposed the justice department 's moderate stance on the matter 
 but in the letters sent in recent days christopher j. <unk> of the irs computing center in detroit told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in <unk> enforcement action being initiated 
 in some cases the irs asked for information dating back to forms it received in N 
 a spokesman for the irs confirmed that there has been <unk> <unk> about incomplete <unk> but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now 
 individuals familiar with the justice department 's policy said that justice officials had n't any knowledge of the irs 's actions in the last week 
 lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors 
 prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business 
 but they have obtained N forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases 
 some criminal lawyers speculated that the irs was sending the letters to test the issue 
 in a number of recent cases federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' <unk> that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential

 fujitsu ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly <unk> for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects while computer rival nec corp. made a written <unk> for <unk> in the same practice 
 meanwhile business and government leaders <unk> the computer makers and <unk> about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about japanese <unk> pricing 
 fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a u.s. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years 
 the company also disclosed that during that period it offered N yen or about $ N for another contract 
 but fujitsu japan 's no. N computer maker is n't alone 
 nec one of its largest domestic competitors said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since N 
 in both cases nec lost the contract to fujitsu which made the same bid and won a <unk> <unk> 
 all the contracts were for <unk> contracts and involved no hardware or software

 the bids he added were contrary to common sense 
 nec released a statement saying we feel sorry for having caused trouble to society a form of <unk> common in japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations 
 japanese companies have long had a reputation for <unk> short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits 
 but the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having <unk> affairs are coming under close ethical scrutiny 
 the fire is also fueled by growing international interest in japanese behavior 
 so far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue 
 but in one of the auctions in question international business machines corp. made a bid substantially higher than the fujitsu offer according to the <unk> 
 the <unk> bids touch on issues central to the increasingly <unk> trade debate 
 foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in japan in part because japanese companies unfairly undercut them 
 the u.s. government in recent years has accused japanese companies of <unk> slashing prices on semiconductors and <unk> products fujitsu and nec make 
 asked whether the bidding <unk> would hurt <unk> relations mr. <unk> said this will be a minus factor 
 the <unk> controversy first came to a head last week when the city of hiroshima announced that fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to <unk> its waterworks 
 the city had expected to pay about N million yen $ N but fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free 
 then wednesday fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in <unk> <unk> two weeks earlier

 in september the <unk> maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $ N million to $ N million net loss for the third quarter 
 but company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $ N million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more <unk> production techniques 
 over the summer months there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector our primary market said wilfred j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer 
 in addition recent industry forecasts for N indicate a slow environment at least until midyear 
 as a result the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and make appropriate reductions in operating expenses 
 the $ N million net loss <unk> N cents a share 
 not counting the extraordinary charge the company said it would have had a net loss of $ N million or seven cents a share 
 a year earlier it had profit of $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the charge partly reflects a switch from older <unk> to <unk> <unk> silicon <unk> with which to <unk> chips 
 related to that decision the company said it was converting its santa clara calif. factory to a research and development facility 
 a spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force

 the dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday buoyed by persistent japanese demand for u.s. bond issues 
 while market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish u.s. economic indicators dealers note that japanese demand has helped <unk> the dollar against the yen and has kept the u.s. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark 
 at the same time dealers said the u.s. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks in part because the hefty japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength resulting in a <unk> 
 jay <unk> with capital insight inc. reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well the mark climbed to N yen from N yen late tuesday in new york the strength of the u.s. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds rather than mark bonds

 he cites the recent deal between the mitsubishi estate co. and the rockefeller group as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed japanese company in the georgia-pacific corp. takeover bid for great northern nekoosa corp. as evidence 
 the <unk> maturity in november of a 10-year japanese government <unk> bond issue valued at about $ N billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors <unk> the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments according to mr. madison 
 it remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over

 sea containers ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ <unk> buy-back plan if pressed by temple holdings ltd. which made an earlier tender offer for sea containers 
 sea containers a hamilton <unk> shipping concern said tuesday that it would sell $ N billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about N N of its common shares for $ N apiece 
 the move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns <unk> holding ag and <unk> plc 
 in may the two companies through their jointly owned holding company temple offered $ N a share or $ N million for sea containers 
 in august temple sweetened the offer to $ N a share or $ N million 
 yesterday sea containers ' chief executive officer james <unk> said in an interview that under the <unk> plan sea containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ N million 
 about $ N million of that would be allocated to the buy-back leaving about $ N million he said 
 that $ N million mr. <unk> said gives us some flexibility in case temple raises its bid 
 we are able to increase our price above the $ N level if necessary 
 he declined to say however how much sea containers might raise its price 
 mr. <unk> speculated that the <unk> that sea containers has means that temple would have to substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us 
 temple however <unk> criticized sea containers ' plan yesterday <unk> it as a highly conditional device designed to <unk> management <unk> shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer 
 a spokesman for temple estimated that sea containers ' plan if all the asset sales <unk> would result in shareholders receiving only $ N to $ N a share in cash 
 the lower figures the spokesman said would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that sea containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market 
 temple added that sea containers is still mired in legal problems in <unk> where the supreme court has temporarily barred sea containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by <unk> and <unk>

 the department proposed requiring stronger <unk> for light trucks and minivans beginning with N models 
 it also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to <unk> light trucks and minivans with <unk> belts for rear seats beginning in the N model year 
 such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats 
 today 's action transportation secretary samuel skinner said represents another <unk> in the ongoing program to promote vehicle <unk> safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards 
 in september the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same <unk> <unk> that have long been required on passenger cars 
 the big three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans 
 safety advocates including some members of congress have been urging the department for years to extend <unk> requirements to light trucks and vans which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the u.s. 
 they say that many vehicles <unk> as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars

 we 're in a very different regulatory environment 
 sen. john <unk> r. <unk> praised the department 's actions noting that <unk> crashes account for almost half of all <unk> deaths 
 we could prevent many of these <unk> with minimum <unk> standards he said 
 sen. <unk> and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved <unk> protection

 the <unk> would be required to withstand a force of N times the <unk> weight of the vehicle

 it is in my <unk> the best wine <unk> 's leap has produced and with fewer than N cases available it is sure to sell quickly 
 the price is a new high for california cabernet <unk> but it is not the highest 
 diamond creek N lake <unk> cabernet weighed in this fall with a <unk> price of $ N a bottle 
 one of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of <unk> wines limited in production of <unk> quality or so perceived at any rate and with <unk> high prices 
 for years this group included a stable of <unk> <unk> first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> grand <unk> <unk> <unk> and la <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> sweet wines <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> from germany and <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> 
 these first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ N to $ N a bottle 
 in the last year or so however this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members 
 the <unk> have <unk> in price to meet the competition and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the <unk> single bottle among current releases from every major wine region on the globe 
 france can <unk> the lion 's share of high-priced bottles 
 <unk> 's first <unk> from N and N are $ N to $ N each except for the smallest in terms of production <unk> <unk> which costs around $ N 
 these prices seem rather modest however in light of other french wines from current <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> the leading <unk> now goes for well over $ N a bottle for a lighter vintage like N the <unk> rich N runs $ N 
 in champagne some of the prestige <unk> are <unk> toward $ N a bottle

 the <unk> salon is $ N

 e. <unk> 's N <unk> <unk> la <unk> for example is $ N 
 none of france 's wine regions can steal a march on <unk> however

 there are certain <unk> wines that can command these higher prices says larry shapiro of <unk> 's one of the largest wine shops in dallas 
 what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out 
 we 're seeing it partly because older <unk> are growing more scarce 
 wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines mr. shapiro continued we 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the <unk> and <unk> which go for $ N to $ N a bottle 
 some of the newer wines even at $ N to $ N a bottle or so almost offer a bargain 
 take lake <unk> cabernet from diamond creek 
 it 's made only in years when the <unk> <unk> perfectly the last was N and comes from a single <unk> of <unk> that yielded a mere N cases in N 
 owner al <unk> originally planned to sell it for $ N a bottle but when a retailer in southern california asked is that wholesale or retail he <unk> the matter 
 offering the wine at roughly $ N a bottle wholesale $ N retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers N no the wine is too high N responses N yes it 's high but i 'll take it N responses N i 'll take all i can get N responses 
 the wine was shipped in <unk> cases instead of the usual N but even at that it was spread thin going to N retailers in N states 
 we thought it was <unk> expensive said sterling <unk> wine director at <unk> 's in <unk> ill. one of the top stores in suburban chicago but there are people out there with very different opinions of value 
 we got our two <unk> and they 're gone 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that he thinks <unk> prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on 
 even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move 
 there may be <unk> reaction initially said mr. <unk> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the <unk> price to add it to their collection 
 it 's just sort of a <unk> thing with some people added larry shapiro 
 they like to talk about having the new red rock <unk> one of diamond creek 's <unk> or the dunn N cabernet or the <unk> 
 producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people 
 that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly 
 but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago 
 they wo n't buy if the quality is not there said <unk> martin of martin wine <unk> in new orleans 
 or if they feel the wine is <unk> and they can get something equally good for less 
 mr. martin has increased prices on some wines like <unk> hills <unk> now $ N just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the $ N to $ N range 
 image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced 
 wine merchants ca n't keep <unk> <unk> in stock but they have to push salon <unk> <unk> even lowering the price from $ N to $ N 
 it 's hardly a question of quality the N salon is a beautiful wine but as mr. <unk> noted people have their own ideas about value 
 it 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door 
 in every major market in the u.s. for instance you can buy <unk> la <unk> or <unk> virtually all of the first growth <unk> except <unk> as well as <unk> one and <unk> from california and at the moment the <unk> 's leap N <unk> N 
 with the biggest <unk> period of the year looming as the holidays approach it will be interesting to see how the <unk> fare

 the fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about N percentage point to N N after the oct. N stock market plunge but has shown no sign of movement since

 retail sales also were reported slow in most districts particularly for discretionary <unk> items such as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics

 despite the economic slowdown there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt

 mr. black said he is pleased with the economy 's recent performance and does n't see a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession 
 there is always a chance of recession added mr. <unk> but if you ask me to put a percentage on it i would think it 's well below a N N chance

 in september union <unk> corp. of memphis tenn. launched the edge account a package designed for the <unk> crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans 
 the theory such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years 
 for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the <unk> segment with the highest savings 
 those efforts are being stepped up 
 <unk> macdonald vice president of retail sales at barnett banks inc. of <unk> fla. says the company now targets <unk> within the market by <unk> its popular seniors partners program to various life styles 
 <unk> age geography and <unk> differences create numerous <unk> ms. macdonald says 
 she says individual barnett branches can add different benefits to their seniors partners package such as athletic activities or travel clubs to appeal to local market interests 
 an active <unk> in <unk> <unk> may care more about senior olympic games while a <unk> in panama city may care more about a <unk> on health she says 
 banks have tried packaging before 
 in N wells fargo & co. of san francisco launched the gold account which included free checking a credit card <unk> box and travelers checks for a $ N monthly fee 
 the concept <unk> a slew of <unk> but the banks stopped promoting the packages 
 one big reason thin margins 
 many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to <unk> and could n't target market <unk> that would have made the programs more profitable 
 as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs 
 but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography 
 they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s 
 deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as <unk> cds 
 where a bank once offered a standard <unk> savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and <unk> checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits 
 the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <unk> corp. of minneapolis and chemical banking corp. of new york extend their market-share <unk> into small towns across the nation 
 today a banker is worrying about local regional and <unk> banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says ms. moore at <unk> research 
 so people who were n't even thinking about targeting N years ago are scrambling to define their customer base 
 the competition has <unk> a much <unk> consumer 
 the average household will spread N accounts over a dozen financial institutions says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c 
 this much <unk> makes attracting and keeping today 's <unk> customers costly 
 packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place 
 for their troubles the banks get a larger <unk> audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate 
 the more accounts customers have mr. sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it 
 that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to <unk> 
 packaging has some <unk> 
 the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive 
 chemical bank spent more than $ N million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in N according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing 
 it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay mr. jacob says 
 still bankers expect packaging to <unk> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs 
 these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them ms. moore says 
 some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte 
 first union he says now has packages for seven customer groups 
 soon it will split those into N 
 says mr. sale i think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the <unk> 
 iras 
 <unk> inc. said it will <unk> a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission to <unk> a plan to sell N newly issued common shares 
 the chandler ariz. company said it will <unk> the registration to cover only the N million warrants each exercisable for the purchase of one common share 
 currently <unk> has about N million common shares outstanding 
 <unk> develops and markets low-cost software peripheral equipment and accessories for computers

 N make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an american savings-and-loan association through the foster corporate parents plan 
 americans today spend $ N like <unk> change they do n't think much about it 
 but for an ailing savings-and-loan association <unk> on <unk> it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise 
 your $ N will help keep a <unk> savings and loan <unk> and out of the federal budget deficit 
 as a foster corporate parent you 'll be helping a neighborhood s&l in areas crucial to its survival 
 like healthy regulatory capital 
 a steady deposit base 
 performing loans 
 at the same time you 'll give your foster savings institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors for good 
 as a foster corporate parent you will experience the same <unk> felt by robert bass lewis <unk> william simon and others who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves 
 that builds confidence <unk> <unk> not to mention critical regulatory net worth 
 do n't wait a savings institution needs your help now 
 every day you delay a savings institution 's health and the federal budget deficit grows worse 
 think about the good you can do for just $ N a month about the cost of a <unk> chevrolet or two <unk> at a state university 
 then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad <unk> in the press and on its bottom line 
 every $ N you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale and keep your foster savings institution off the federal budget deficit 
 mr. <unk> is a lawyer in new york 
 the chicago mercantile exchange said it plans to institute an additional circuit breaker aimed at stemming market <unk> 
 separately john phelan told a closed house subcommittee meeting in washington that he would support securities and exchange commission halts of program trading during market <unk> 
 but the new york stock exchange chairman said he does n't support <unk> a collar on program trading arguing that firms could get around such a limit 
 the chicago merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its standard & poor 's N stock-index futures pit once s&p N futures fell N index points the equivalent of about a <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average 
 if the <unk> limit is triggered after N p.m chicago time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at N p.m 
 with the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it 
 the exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on friday oct. N when the dow jones industrials plunged N points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well 
 late that afternoon the s&p N stock-index futures contract fell a total of N index points hitting a merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session 
 the merc said that its existing <unk> <unk> limit on s&p N stock-index futures trading equal to about N points on the dow jones industrials which was triggered oct. N will remain in effect 
 leo <unk> merc executive committee chairman said that the <unk> limit appeared to <unk> the selling panic oct. N 
 but when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <unk> limit indicated that the intermediate limit of N points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices <unk> 
 several traders maintained that the merc 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the market slide oct. N by <unk> additional selling pressure to the floor of the new york stock exchange 
 all of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly 
 the exchange also said that the <unk> circuit breaker which currently provides only a one-hour <unk> during market <unk> will become the maximum one-day limit for the s&p N stock-index futures contract the one-day limit now is N index points 
 a final <unk> was made to the <unk> opening limit for the contract 
 the merc said that <unk> limit will remain in effect for the first N minutes of trading 
 the limit <unk> under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening N minutes of trading 
 in washington house aides said mr. phelan told congressmen that the collar which banned program trades through the big board 's computer when the dow jones industrial average moved N points did n't work well 
 he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades <unk> 
 in a <unk> news conference mr. phelan who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said he told the house finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal providing the sec would be comfortable with the language in a bill 
 the program-trading issue is heating up on capitol hill as it is on wall street and several legislators want to grant the sec the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile 
 sec chairman richard breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have <unk> trigger points but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs 
 a house aide suggested that mr. phelan was so vague and <unk> that it was the kind of meeting where people of all <unk> could come out feeling good 
 at one point mr. phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman rep. edward markey d. mass. by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers 
 markey said we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said 
 mr. phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added 
 at another point during the hearing rep. markey asked mr. phelan what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today 
 mr. phelan said the big board is likely to study the program-trading issue 
 that response <unk> rep. markey house aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter 
 <unk> of the N subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably rep. john dingell d. mich. the full house energy and commerce committee chairman who has been willing to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent months 
 mr. dingell expressed concern sources said about <unk> problems in <unk> program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades 
 the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses 
 the art of <unk> is <unk> to the english and like most english <unk> <unk> to the rest of the world 
 <unk> l. <unk> the nine <unk> 
 <unk> england 
 of all scenes that <unk> rural england this is one of the <unk> an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells <unk> from its tower calling the <unk> to <unk> 
 the <unk> of st. michael and all angels stop to <unk> at the church door as members here always have 
 in the tower five men and women pull <unk> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in N 
 but there is also a <unk> modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the <unk> enjoying the <unk> of bells this cool autumn evening 
 like most of the other N <unk> in britain with sets of bells st. michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every sunday morning and evening service 
 now only one local ringer remains <unk> <unk> hammond 
 the others here today live elsewhere 
 they belong to a group of N ringers including two <unk> and four youngsters in training who drive every sunday from church to church in a <unk> effort to keep the bells <unk> in the many <unk> of east <unk> 
 to ring for even one service at this tower we have to <unk> says mr. hammond a retired <unk> worker 
 we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their <unk> and their <unk> and they just <unk> away 
 mr. hammond worries that old age and the <unk> of youth will <unk> the ranks of the east <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells <unk> 
 history after all is not on his side 
 according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england 's church bells are no longer <unk> on <unk> because there is no one to ring them 
 it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes 
 the less complicated version of playing <unk> on bells as do the <unk> of continental europe is considered by the english to be <unk> fit only for foreigners 
 <unk> a <unk> exercise the english invented N years ago requires physical <unk> some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration 
 proper english bells are started off in <unk> from the <unk> bell to the lowest a simple <unk> scale using in larger <unk> as many as N bells 
 then at a signal the ringers begin <unk> the order in which the bells sound without <unk> the steady <unk> of the striking 
 each <unk> or change can occur only once the rules state 
 ringers <unk> patterns of changes known as methods which have <unk> names like kent <unk> bob major or <unk> <unk> 
 a series of N or so changes is a <unk> and takes about three hours 
 a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary <unk> church in the <unk> district of london gives an idea of the work involved 
 ten <unk> ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a <unk> 's stance each pulling a <unk> that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber 
 no one speaks and the <unk> of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves <unk> by the ceiling 
 totally absorbed the ringers <unk> straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it <unk> to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls 
 far above in the <unk> the huge <unk> bells mounted on wheels swing <unk> through a full N degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the <unk> or <unk> position 
 skilled ringers use their <unk> to advance or <unk> the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change 
 in a well-known <unk> involving church bells english novelist <unk> l. <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in <unk> <unk> and mechanical <unk> 
 ringers she added are filled with the <unk> <unk> that comes of <unk> <unk> <unk> performed 
 ringing does become a bit of an <unk> admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at st. mary <unk> and one of england 's best female ringers 
 it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however 
 more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the <unk> 
 when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often <unk> off to the local <unk> leaving <unk> for others below 
 this does not sit well with some <unk> 
 with membership of the church of england steadily <unk> <unk> <unk> are pressing equally <unk> and often <unk> ringers to attend services 
 two years ago the rev. <unk> <unk> vicar of great <unk> <unk> got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he <unk> the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest 
 they were a <unk> club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the vicar <unk> says 
 an entirely new band <unk> today at great <unk> several of whom are members of the <unk> 
 but there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells 
 at st. mary 's church in <unk> <unk> the bells have fallen silent following a <unk> over church attendance 
 the vicar <unk> jones refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound 
 but <unk> marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the <unk> from the bell tower that are located next to the <unk> 
 so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the <unk> is at <unk> he says 
 vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active <unk> himself 
 the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says 
 i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that <unk> life 
 the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with <unk> says john c. baldwin president 
 it hopes to speak to students at <unk> colleges about the <unk> of bell ringing and will shortly publish a <unk> for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care 
 says mr. baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience 
 mr. baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers 
 one survey says that of the N trained <unk> in england today only N of them still ring 
 also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be <unk> like in small rural <unk> and inner-city <unk> 
 but the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says mr. baldwin 
 right now we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of N he adds 
 one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once <unk> field more than a third of the ringers today are women 
 they are n't accepted everywhere however 
 the oldest <unk> group in the country the ancient society of college <unk> founded in N remains <unk> a fact that 's particularly <unk> to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain 's most prestigious <unk> st. paul 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 this being britain no woman has filed an <unk> suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the ringing world a weekly newspaper for ringers 
 one writer signing his letter as <unk> balanced male <unk> on the frequency of women <unk> in <unk> and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings 
 in the <unk> of replies that followed one woman ringer from <unk> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be <unk> badly dressed <unk> with <unk> and a large <unk> frequently <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
 another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her N years of ringing i have never known a lady to <unk> in the <unk> 
 i have seen one or two men die <unk> them 
 investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable <unk> of quarterly dividend checks 
 that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than N N 
 but do n't <unk> too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn 
 in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over 
 that can be a trap for <unk> investors says richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co 
 strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female <unk> that attract males and then kill them after <unk> 
 stephen boesel president of t. rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most <unk> only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time 
 invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to <unk> environments he says 
 and <unk> environments are n't <unk> to the stock market 
 indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical <unk> 
 in N for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared N N following much slower growth the year before 
 the s&p index started sliding in price in september N and fell N N in N despite a N N expansion in dividends that year 
 that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious 
 payouts on the s&p N stocks rose N N in N according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for N growth are generally between N N and N N 
 many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double-digit gains continuing 
 meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen <unk> their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices 
 as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and <unk> by historical standards 
 put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say 
 they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p N 
 the figure is currently about N N up from N N before the recent market slide 
 some analysts say investors should run for the <unk> if a sustained market rebound <unk> the yield below N N 
 a drop below that N N benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says mr. boesel of t. rowe price 
 in fact the market has always <unk> 
 always 
 there 's never been an exception says gerald w. <unk> a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data 
 the last time the s&p N yield dropped below N N was in the summer of N 
 stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle 
 there have been only seven other times in N N N N N N and N when the yield on the s&p N dropped below N N for at least two consecutive months mr. <unk> found 
 and in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year 
 still some market analysts say the current N N reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past 
 it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not <unk> in a traditional manner says james h. <unk> head of stock investments for cigna corp. the <unk> insurer 
 in particular mr. <unk> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically 
 so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength 
 rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes steven g. einhorn <unk> of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs & co 
 he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about N N 
 that is just a <unk> below the average of the past N years or so he says 
 what will happen to dividend growth next year 
 common wisdom suggests a <unk> rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits 
 painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year 
 in other years in which there have been moderate economic <unk> the environment the firm expects in N the change in dividends ranged from a gain of N N to a decline of N N according to painewebber analyst thomas <unk> 
 the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial <unk> this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken 
 dividend growth on the order of N N is expected by both mr. <unk> of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs 
 those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures 
 one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends 
 a total of N companies raised dividends in october basically unchanged from N a year ago s&p said wednesday 
 that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace 
 while the s&p tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further <unk> in the number of dividend increases could be a <unk> of slower dividend growth next year 
 in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels 
 mr. einhorn of goldman sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a N N to N N total return from appreciation and dividends over the next N months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps N N or N N if dividend growth is weak 
 but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects N N growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much 
 having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration he says 
 with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels

 mr. nixon the most prominent american to come to china since beijing 's bloody <unk> of pro-democracy demonstrators in june <unk> on international <unk> over the massacre 
 the chinese in turn took aim at american <unk> in china 's domestic affairs 
 one official newspaper legal daily even directly criticized mr. nixon who is normally referred to here as an old friend 
 the paper accused him of being a leading <unk> of peaceful evolution a catch phrase to describe what china believes is the policy of western countries to <unk> socialist nations into the capitalist <unk> 
 the tension was evident on wednesday evening during mr. nixon 's final <unk> <unk> normally an opportunity for <unk> <unk> about <unk> friendship 
 instead mr. nixon reminded his host chinese president <unk> <unk> that americans have n't <unk> china 's leaders for the military assault of june N that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators 
 many in the united states including many friends of china believe the crackdown was excessive and <unk> mr. nixon told mr. <unk> who was directly involved in ordering the attack 
 the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china 
 the chinese responded in an equally <unk> fashion 
 in talks with mr. nixon chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the u.s. was <unk> involved in the demonstrations this spring 
 in a meeting tuesday supreme leader deng <unk> told mr. nixon frankly speaking the u.s. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and <unk> <unk> which occurred in beijing not long ago 
 china was the real victim and it is <unk> to <unk> china for it 
 despite the harsh exchanges the u.s. and china still seem to be looking for a way to <unk> relations which have deteriorated into what mr. nixon referred to as the greatest crisis in <unk> relations since his initial visit to china N years ago

 according to an american member of the nixon party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his N hours of talks with <unk> chinese officials 
 these included china 's economic policies human rights and the question of mr. <unk> 
 mr. nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the <unk> program a u.s. <unk> academic exchange 
 china pulled out of the program in july 
 in his talks the former president urged china 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the <unk> of outside contacts and ideas 
 ideas are going over borders and there 's no sdi ideological weapon that can shoot them down he told a group of americans at the u.s. embassy on wednesday 
 there are no signs however of china 's yielding on key issues 
 but in one minor matter mr. nixon appears to have gained a <unk> 
 in a meeting with premier <unk> <unk> on monday mr. nixon said that he hoped he would n't <unk> guards with machine guns during his visit to the u.s. embassy 
 sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the <unk> guards were gone for the first time in five months 
 a few blocks away at the u.s. ambassador 's residence the guards <unk> the compound also had discarded their <unk> arms for the first time since early june

 program traders are <unk> of predicting that if they are blocked in the u.s. they will simply <unk> to foreign stock markets 
 but in london and tokyo where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role traders say a number of hurdles <unk> 
 government officials especially in japan probably would resist any <unk> of program trading by players trying to <unk> off the u.s. furor over their activities and <unk> abroad with their business 
 japan is very concerned about the possible effects of program trading a senior japanese official said after the oct. N stock plunge in new york 
 u.s. stock-index futures are n't even traded in japan now 
 and because of the time difference the japanese and the u.s. markets ' trading hours do n't <unk> 
 it all adds up to a barrier to <unk> index arbitrage the most popular form of u.s. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in new york and the price of a futures contract in chicago based on those stocks 
 about N N of all program trading by new york stock exchange firms in september took place in foreign markets according to big board data 
 yet it is difficult to imagine japan racing to introduce <unk> stock-index futures 
 japan 's finance ministry already is <unk> institutional investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading said <unk> utsumi vice minister for international finance 
 program trading has taken off in japan since last year 's introduction of <unk> stock-index futures trading on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges 
 but regulators are wary 
 they have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last dec. N when the first <unk> of <unk> index arbitrage drove stocks <unk> in the last half-hour of trading startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing 
 japan 's finance ministry had set up <unk> to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time 
 maybe it was n't enough a finance ministry official noted after the dec. N surge 
 japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on <unk> stock purchases 
 tokyo 's leading program traders are the big u.s. securities houses though the japanese are playing <unk> 
 some u.s. firms notably salomon inc. and morgan stanley group inc. have <unk> a hefty chunk of their japanese earnings from index arbitrage both for customers and for their own accounts 
 morgan stanley last week joined a growing list of u.s. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts 
 both <unk> c. <unk> who heads salomon in tokyo and john s. <unk> who heads morgan stanley there <unk> a good part of their firms ' success in tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients 
 they do n't have plans to cut back 
 it has not been <unk> in the markets here mr. <unk> said 
 the real difference seems to be that the cash market here is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in america 
 the british also are <unk> program trades 
 index-arbitrage trading is something we want to watch closely an official at london 's stock exchange said 
 we do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment 
 london serves increasingly as a <unk> for program trading of u.s. stocks 
 market professionals said london has several <unk> 
 first the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes 
 second it can be used to <unk> positions before u.s. trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session 's big board close 
 in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee 
 still much less index-arbitrage activity is done over here than in the u.s. said richard <unk> chief investment manager at standard life assurance co. which manages about # N billion $ N billion in united kingdom institutional funds 
 britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments 
 a financial times-stock exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the london stock exchange 's traded options market 
 and an ft-se futures contract is traded on the london international financial futures exchange 
 both contracts have gained a following since the N global market crash 
 the average number of ft-se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in N 
 this year the average of daily contracts traded totaled N up from N a year earlier and from N in N 
 but a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of <unk> trading was only N N of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said 
 this compares with estimates that the u.s. <unk> market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market 
 the house voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early N casting a solid N vote for a compromise measure backed by president bush 
 the vote came after a debate <unk> with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor 
 advocates said the <unk> rise to $ N an hour by april N is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs 
 but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on tuesday by president bush and democratic leaders in congress after congressional republicans urged the white house to <unk> a bit from its previous resistance to compromise 
 so both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in N raising the wage to $ N an hour from $ N 
 under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to $ N next april 
 the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it 
 there are no <unk> about this bill rep. pat williams d. <unk> said during house floor debate yesterday 
 but because it 's all we 've got i 'm going to vote for it 
 while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average u.s. manufacturing wage the level of $ N an hour in N will still be less than N N of average factory pay mr. williams said 
 but rep. <unk> <unk> r. n.j instead praised the house 's acceptance of a new youth training wage a <unk> that gop <unk> have sought for many years 
 adopting a <unk> policy means getting beyond the nickel and <unk> of the minimum wage mrs. <unk> said 
 policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help <unk> job skills to <unk> into the work force 
 labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently <unk> to it in the face of bush administration insistence 
 the compromise sets the training wage at $ N an hour next april and at $ N an hour or N N of the minimum wage in april N 
 employers can pay the <unk> for N days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another N days if the company uses a <unk> training program for the young workers 
 the training wage covers only workers who are N to N years old 
 the white house previously insisted on an <unk> six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job 
 the u.s. chamber of commerce still opposed to any <unk> increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor N N in two stages between april N and april N will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher prices for american consumers

 for six years t. marshall hahn jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the george bush mode kind and <unk> 
 the question now can he act more like <unk> teddy <unk> 
 mr. hahn the <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of georgia-pacific corp. is leading the <unk> concern 's unsolicited $ N billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp 
 nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction mr. hahn has n't faced in his N earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes 
 so far mr. hahn is trying to <unk> nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough 
 we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says 
 but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies 
 if a competitor enters the game for example mr. hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival 
 given that choice associates of mr. hahn and industry observers say the former university president who has developed a reputation for not <unk> for anything would <unk> 
 there 's a price above which i 'm positive marshall has the <unk> not to pay says <unk> <unk> georgia-pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper 
 says <unk> associate jerry <unk> vice president corporate development at <unk> industries inc. he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost 
 he also is a consensus manager insiders say 
 the decision to make the bid for nekoosa for example was made only after all six members of georgia-pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal even though mr. hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on says mr. <unk> 
 associates say mr. hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia <unk> institute 
 assuming that post at the age of N he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says warren h. <unk> a university official who is <unk> a book on mr. hahn 
 but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand 
 in N mr. hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were <unk> a university building 
 that impressed robert b. <unk> georgia-pacific 's chief executive at the time whom mr. hahn had met while <unk> for the institute 
 in N mr. <unk> <unk> mr. hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move <unk> many in georgia-pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world 
 but mr. hahn rose swiftly through the ranks <unk> a raw intelligence that he says he knew he <unk> early on 
 the son of a <unk> mr. hahn <unk> first grade because his reading ability was so far above his <unk> 
 moving rapidly through school he <unk> <unk> beta <unk> from the university of kentucky at age N after spending only N N years in college 
 he earned his <unk> in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology 
 mr. hahn agrees that he has a <unk> memory but friends say that 's an <unk> 
 they call it photographic 
 mr. hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific 
 taking over as chief executive officer in N he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a <unk> slide in its <unk> business 
 mr. hahn began selling <unk> businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals 
 he even sold one unit that made <unk> <unk> covers 
 at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while <unk> building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new-home construction 
 the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction 
 the formula has paid off so far 
 georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ N billion last year compared with $ N billion in N when mr. hahn took the reins 
 profit from continuing operations has soared to $ N million from $ N million 
 mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best 
 the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive he says 
 nekoosa would n't be a diversification 
 it would be a good match mr. hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows 
 the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ N billion 
 but can mr. hahn carry it off 
 in this instance industry observers say he is entering <unk> waters 
 says <unk> <unk> an analyst at first manhattan co. this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced 
 a house-senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ N million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ N million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal N in hopes of <unk> future trade and investment 
 for the agency for international development <unk> approved $ N million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $ N million over fiscal N as part of the same poland package 
 the conference approved at least $ N million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than $ N million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration 
 the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year 's budget 
 these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious <unk> legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe 
 to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required to <unk> an estimated $ N million from the pentagon 
 and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively 
 the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ N million for international population planning activities an N N increase over fiscal N 
 the house and senate are divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant 
 in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional $ N million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant 
 the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california <unk> museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market 
 panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of N metric tons over a <unk> period ending sept. N N 
 about a quarter of this share has already been <unk> according to the industry but the remaining N tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of N cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate 
 the potential sales are nearly $ N million and house majority whip william gray d. pa began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <unk> countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and <unk> 
 rep. jerry lewis a conservative <unk> added a provision of his own intended to assist <unk> and the senate then <unk> the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin <unk> as well as the philippines backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye 
 jamaica wary of <unk> its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray but the greater question is whether mr. inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to <unk> a claim by the philippines 
 in separate floor action the house <unk> budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal N 
 the funding is attached to an estimated $ N billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights 
 the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the house 
 the most recent example was a nearly $ N billion fiscal N bill funding the state justice and commerce departments 
 and after losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee <unk> from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference 
 beauty takes <unk> to safety on bridges

 a second <unk> covering the company 's <unk> pa. coke works involved more than N alleged violations of <unk> and other requirements for which osha proposed $ N million in fines 
 labor secretary elizabeth dole said the magnitude of these penalties and <unk> is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate <unk> to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards 
 osha said there have been three worker <unk> at the two plants in the past two years and N deaths since N 
 gerard <unk> the head of osha said usx managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed to take necessary action to <unk> the hazards

 once we do they will receive very serious evaluation the spokesman said 
 no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees 
 usx said it has been <unk> with osha since the agency began investigating the <unk> and <unk> works 
 he said that if and when safety problems were identified they were corrected 
 the usx <unk> represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by osha under mr. <unk> 
 he has promised <unk> fines though the size of penalties sought by osha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year 
 the big problem is that usx management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to <unk> safety and health in the plants said linda <unk> osha regional administrator in philadelphia

 the house passed legislation designed to make it easier for the transportation department to block airline leveraged buy-outs

 the bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an <unk> <unk> into the affairs of industry but the N vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto 
 the broader question is where the senate stands on the issue 
 while the senate commerce committee has approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buy-outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor 
 although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt 
 the purpose of the bill is to put the <unk> on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would <unk> safety or a carrier 's ability to compete rep. john paul <unk> r. ark said 
 the bill as it was approved by the house public works and transportation committee would give the transportation department up to N days to review any purchase of N N or more of the stock in an airline 
 the department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be <unk> its ability to compete would be sharply diminished it would be put into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of <unk> assets unless selling such assets had an <unk> public benefit 
 the house approved an amendment offered by rep. peter <unk> d. ore. that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees or their wages or benefits 
 rep. james <unk> d. ohio said the amendment which passed N would let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally 
 but rep. <unk> said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial 
 on tuesday the house approved a <unk> amendment that would require the transportation department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code 
 the provision called the <unk> amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing texas air corp. chairman frank lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline 
 <unk> report 
 you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice is broadcasting to those N million people around the world who tune in to it each week 
 you can even take notes extensive notes for the voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder about what you read 
 you can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress 
 and my newspaper can print the text of those <unk> 
 until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your <unk> around the world 
 that was the law 
 and i apparently had no right to print <unk> what the voice was booming to <unk> 
 it was censorship 
 it was <unk> 
 and it was stupid 
 the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't <unk> its own people 
 that sounds neat but this government any government <unk> its own people every day 
 government press releases <unk> <unk> tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts 
 propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue 
 the restrictions on <unk> and <unk> of voice material were especially absurd an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform 
 in june N i wrote in this space about this issue 
 assuming it was n't one of those columns that you <unk> and put on the <unk> door i 'll review the facts 
 the voice of america is a government agency that <unk> news and views some might say propaganda in N <unk> to N million <unk> around the world 
 it does a <unk> job 
 its budget $ N million is paid for by you 
 but a N law barred the <unk> of that material in the u.s. 
 the law let scholars reporters and researchers read <unk> of <unk> material only at <unk> headquarters in washington but it barred them from copying <unk> 
 and of course there 's that word <unk> 
 how 's that again 
 you may come by the agency to read but not copy either <unk> or by <unk> a voice official explained when i asked 
 what if i tune in my <unk> radio <unk> an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper 
 nor are you free to <unk> such material i was advised 
 that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere i sued 
 a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in des <unk> 
 at least that 's the way it was reported 
 and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed 
 but i i like to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point 
 for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the united states information agency which runs the voice changed its position on three key points 
 the usia said that on reflection of course i could print anything i could get my hands on 
 the word <unk> it decided referred only to itself 
 the usia officially and publicly declared the <unk> right of everyone except the usia to <unk> agency program materials in the united states my lawyer the <unk> mark mccormick of des <unk> said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost 
 the court noted the new usia position but just in case officially found that congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from <unk> usia information domestically 
 the usia said that on reflection anyone could view the <unk> materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute 
 the usia publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory <unk> because the usia has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and <unk> to see the materials mr. mccormick noted 
 and the usia said that all of us could take extensive notes 
 the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take <unk> notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken mr. mccormick reported 
 i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if i have no right to get the information 
 but the court disagreed 
 the first amendment <unk> the government from passing laws <unk> the right to free speech judge donald o'brien ruled 
 the first amendment does not <unk> a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press 
 so now the situation is this 
 you have a right to read voice of america scripts if you do n't mind traveling to washington every week or so and visiting the voice office during business hours 
 i have a right to print those scripts if i go there and <unk> but no longer <unk> copy them out in long hand 
 but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or have it sent to us 
 in an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd 
 indeed judge o'brien ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the usia 's position is inappropriate or even stupid but it 's the law 
 so the next step i suspect is to try to get the law changed 
 we i assume you 're in this with me at this point need to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law 
 section N of the united states information and educational exchange act of N says voice material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the usia 's new position all of us for examination only 
 if those words were n't there the nice people at the voice would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you <unk> it 
 this is not a <unk> issue 
 you have raised important questions which ought to be answered what does usia say about america abroad how do we say it and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions a man wrote me a couple of years ago 
 the man was charles <unk> <unk> 
 at the time he was director of the 
 he had no answers then 
 now there are some 
 this democracy is suddenly a little more democratic 
 i feel pretty good about it 
 mr. gartner is editor and <unk> of the daily tribune in <unk> iowa and president of nbc news in new york 
 r. gordon mcgovern was forced out as campbell soup co. 's president and chief executive officer the strongest evidence yet of the power that dorrance family members intend to <unk> in <unk> the troubled food company 
 herbert m. baum the <unk> president of the company 's campbell u.s.a. unit and edwin l. harper N the chief financial officer will run campbell as a team <unk> responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named 
 the board already has been searching for strong outside candidates including <unk> executives with considerable international experience 
 wall street reacted <unk> to mr. mcgovern 's departure and its implications 
 in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange campbell 's shares rose $ N to close at $ N 
 the profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better said john <unk> a food industry analyst for prudential-bache in new york 
 mr. mcgovern was widely seen as sales and not profit <unk> 
 new managers would think a little more like wall street mr. <unk> added 
 some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of campbell shares in recent months 
 campbell 's international businesses particularly in the u.k. and italy appear to be at the heart of its problems 
 growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in u.s. units 
 for example campbell is a distant third in the u.k. frozen foods market where it recently paid N times earnings for <unk> foods plc and wound up with far more capacity than it could use 
 similarly campbell 's italian <unk> operation d. <unk> & co. has been hurt by <unk> and distribution problems 
 such problems will require considerable <unk> to resolve 
 however neither mr. baum nor mr. harper has much international experience 
 mr. baum a <unk> marketer who is said to have a good <unk> with campbell employees will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <unk> farm unit 
 mr. harper a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in N will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <unk> 
 in an joint interview yesterday both men said they would like to be the company 's next chief executive 
 mr. mcgovern N had been under intense pressure from the board to boost campbell 's <unk> performance to the level of other food companies 
 the board is dominated by the <unk> of the late john t. dorrance jr. who controlled about N N of campbell 's stock when he died in april 
 in recent months mr. dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity 
 in august the company took a $ N million pretax charge against fiscal N earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan 
 the plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about N jobs 
 but analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing especially in europe and there were signs that the board became <unk> 
 campbell officials said mr. mcgovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure 
 the company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying the ceo succession is well along and i 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement 
 but people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in london said mr. mcgovern was fired 
 mr. mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of N in october N unless i get fired 
 campbell said mr. mcgovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for nov. N 
 for fiscal N mr. mcgovern received a salary of $ N 
 he owns about N shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more than N additional shares 
 he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ N with certain other <unk> benefits 
 during mr. mcgovern 's <unk> term as president the company 's sales rose to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income increased to $ N million from $ N million the statement said 
 mr. baum said he and mr. harper both <unk> closing some plants as long ago as early N 
 you 've got to make the restructuring work said mr. baum 
 you 've got to make those savings now 
 mr. harper expressed confidence that he and mr. baum can convince the board of their <unk> to run the company 
 we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team he said 
 he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive 
 mr. baum said the two have orders to focus on <unk> profits and to take a hard look at our businesses what is good what is not so good 
 analysts generally <unk> the performance of campbell u.s.a. the company 's largest division which posted N N unit sales growth and a N N improvement in operating profit for fiscal N 
 the way that we 've been managing campbell u.s.a. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company mr. baum said 
 in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon both men <unk> confidence and seemed to work well together 
 you 've got two <unk> sitting right before you said mr. baum

 robert l. bernstein chairman and president of random house inc. announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for N years 
 a successor was n't named which fueled speculation that mr. bernstein may have <unk> with <unk> newhouse jr. whose family company advance publications inc. owns random house 
 abrupt departures are n't <unk> of within the newhouse empire 
 in an interview mr. bernstein said his departure <unk> out of discussions with <unk> newhouse and that 's the decision i reached 
 he declined to elaborate other than to say it just seemed the right thing to do at this minute 
 sometimes you just go with your gut 
 mr. bernstein said he will stay until dec. N and work with his successor who is to be named soon 
 mr. newhouse meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with mr. bernstein or the performance of random house the largest trade publishing house in the u.s. 
 the company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ N million from $ N million during mr. bernstein 's tenure 
 bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite <unk> said mr. newhouse 
 the company is doing well it 's stable it 's got good people 
 bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time 
 publishing officials believe that while random house has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily 
 crown publishing group acquired last year is said to be turning in disappointing results 
 as a private company random house does n't report its earnings 
 mr. bernstein who succeeded bennett <unk> has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in N 
 speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house 
 possible candidates include susan <unk> president of <unk> <unk> random house 's huge and successful <unk> division 
 some say anthony <unk> head of a recently acquired british company century hutchinson could be chosen 
 there is also speculation that mr. newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another newhouse family member to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like robert <unk> who left random house 's alfred a. <unk> to run the new yorker also owned by the newhouse family 
 not included on the <unk> list are <unk> evans recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for random house and <unk> mehta president of the prestigious alfred a. <unk> unit 
 when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator 
 mr. mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a <unk> administrator and his own departure was rumored recently 
 mr. bernstein a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues 
 congress learned during the reagan administration that it could <unk> the executive branch by <unk> again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent 
 this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress 
 it signals congress 's attempt under the <unk> of <unk> the public <unk> to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article ii of the constitution 
 this <unk> of congressional action is <unk> on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is <unk> and unconstitutional 
 the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law 
 the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an <unk> veto over every <unk> action of the president through the ability to <unk> funding 
 this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in N in the iran-contra report 
 as <unk> of congressional power understand a power of the <unk> so broadly <unk> would <unk> the presidency and <unk> the principle of separation of powers 
 it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution 
 the <unk> hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of N according to madison 's notes 
 to the extent they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability 
 moreover the <unk> believed that the nation needed a <unk> executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed poorly under the articles of confederation 
 it would <unk> that objective if the appropriations clause technically a <unk> on legislative power could be read as placing the president on congress 's short <unk> making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress 
 as it went to the conference panel now <unk> the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal N contained some <unk> attempts by congress to rewrite the constitution under the <unk> of protecting the public 's money 
 during the coming weeks president bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their <unk> on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus <unk> and <unk> 
 the N appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii 
 article ii places on the president the duty to <unk> and by and with the advice and consent of the senate <unk> <unk> judges and other officers of the u.s. 
 it also <unk> the president to make <unk> appointments without senate approval the president shall have power to fill up all <unk> that may happen during the <unk> of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session 
 yet section N of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides no part of any <unk> for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been <unk> after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person 
 thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress <unk> the president 's power to make <unk> appointments under article ii 
 section N also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> candidates of his choosing 
 the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected <unk> will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary 
 the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the <unk> act prohibits voluntary service to the government 
 the N appropriations bills also contain a number of <unk> provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution 
 <unk> provisions which might be called <unk> laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to congress 
 such laws violate the provision in article ii that requires the president to make recommendations to congress but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations 
 typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from <unk> into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more <unk> alternatives to regulations 
 probably the most <unk> example is a <unk> in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's office of management and budget from <unk> agricultural marketing orders to any <unk> scrutiny 
 there is something <unk> suspect about congress 's <unk> the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other 
 perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal N better illustrates congress 's attempt to <unk> executive power than section N of the <unk> bill none of the funds made available <unk> to the provisions of this act shall be used to implement <unk> or enforce any regulation which has been <unk> <unk> to a resolution of <unk> <unk> adopted in <unk> with the applicable law of the united states 
 this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law since a <unk> resolution could be said to be <unk> adopted even though it would require neither <unk> action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto 
 the supreme court 's decision in <unk> v. <unk> held that legislative <unk> are unconstitutional 
 president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> his duties and exercise his prerogatives 
 if president bush fails to do so in his first year he will <unk> congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the constitution to suit its purposes 
 what becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including democrats to undo 
 president reagan learned that lesson 
 by N <unk> jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii 
 if a veto is <unk> because it would leave part of the executive branch <unk> the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and <unk> a power of <unk> declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and <unk> 
 the constitution does not <unk> give the president such power 
 however the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution 
 the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto 
 <unk> of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and <unk> under article ii would be different from the line-item veto 
 as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to <unk> perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are <unk> merely because they conflict with his policy objectives 
 the <unk> of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited <unk> 
 one could argue that it is not an <unk> of a item veto at all for the president by <unk> a power of <unk> to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers 
 there is no downside if the president asserts a right of <unk> over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal N appropriations bills 
 if congress does nothing president bush will have won 
 if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win 
 in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a <unk> of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the <unk> thought should be <unk> to the executive 
 if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v. <unk> was for the reagan administration 
 but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now 
 moreover the <unk> would have received a valuable <unk> lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice 
 as it stands now congress <unk> after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down 
 president bush should set things straight 
 if he does not he will help realize madison 's fear in the <unk> no. N of a legislature everywhere extending the <unk> of its activity and drawing all powers into its <unk> <unk> 
 mr. <unk> served as an attorney in the reagan administration 
 his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year 
 despite one of the most devastating <unk> on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ N billion last year 
 the previous record was $ N billion in N according to the agriculture department 
 net cash income the amount left in farmers ' pockets after <unk> expenses from gross cash income increased in N states in N as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department 's economic research service reported yesterday 
 most of those states set farm income records 
 the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains 
 what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had <unk> to the government under <unk> loan programs 
 with prices soaring they were able to sell the <unk> commodities at considerable profit the agency 's <unk> report said 
 in less <unk> areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production <unk> greatly from the higher prices 
 to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the <unk> states including indiana illinois nebraska and the <unk> 
 analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ N billion <unk> package enacted by congress 
 last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s 
 it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm <unk> and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the N farm program next year 
 commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record <unk> earlier this year as the government curtailed production with <unk> programs to reduce <unk> surpluses 
 at the same time export demand for u.s. wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said keith collins a department analyst 
 farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low 
 all of these forces came together in N to benefit agriculture mr. collins said 
 california led the nation with $ N billion in net cash income last year followed by texas $ N billion iowa $ N billion florida $ N billion and minnesota $ N billion 
 iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states to <unk> a decline in net cash income 
 despite federal disaster relief the drought of N was a severe financial setback for an estimated N to N farmers according to the department 
 many lost their farms 
 department economists do n't expect N to be as good a year as N was 
 indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline 
 at the same time an increase of land under <unk> after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly <unk> by heavy grain buying by the soviets 
 last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ N billion from a record $ N billion in N 
 payments are expected to range between $ N billion and $ N billion this year 
 after years of struggling the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent hearst corp. following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper 
 the demise of the <unk> herald once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding N turns the country 's second-largest city into a <unk> town at least in some <unk> 
 the los angeles times with a circulation of more than N million dominates the region 
 but it faces stiff competition in orange county from the orange county register which sells more than N copies a day and in the san fernando valley from the los angeles daily news which sells more than N 
 nearby cities such as pasadena and long beach also have large <unk> 
 in july closely held hearst based in new york put the paper on the block 
 speculation had it that the company was asking $ N million for an operation said to be losing about $ N million a year but others said hearst might have virtually given the paper away 
 an attempted buy-out led by john j. <unk> chief operating officer never materialized and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as <unk> and <unk> had filed through since 
 the prospective buyers included investor marvin davis and the toronto sun 
 the death of the herald a <unk> paper in a freeway town was perhaps inevitable 
 los angeles is a <unk> <unk> newspaper market and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the <unk> times then target a particular area with one of the regional <unk> 
 the herald was left in limbo 
 further the herald seemed torn <unk> between keeping its <unk> hearst <unk> blue-collar and <unk> and trying to provide a <unk> upscale alternative to the sometimes <unk> times 
 hearst had <unk> with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan 
 the herald joins the baltimore <unk> which <unk> and the boston <unk> which was sold as <unk> of the old hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s 
 many felt hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did if marginally because of its place in family history 
 its <unk> offices were designed by architect <unk> morgan who built the hearst castle at san <unk> 
 william <unk> hearst had kept an apartment in the spanish <unk> building 
 analysts said the herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry 
 the herald was a <unk> from a <unk> age said j. <unk> noble a media analyst with painewebber inc 
 actually the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end and the industry looks pretty healthy 
 founded as the examiner in N by mr. hearst the herald was <unk> by a bitter <unk> strike that began in N and cut circulation in half 
 financially it never recovered <unk> it had its moments 
 in N hearst hired editor james <unk> who <unk> the editorial product considerably 
 he and his successor mary anne <unk> restored respect for the editorial product and though in recent years the paper had been <unk> along on limited resources its <unk> were notable 
 for example the herald consistently beat its <unk> rival on disclosures about los angeles mayor tom bradley 's financial dealings 
 the herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded 
 robert j. <unk> vice president and general manager of hearst newspapers stood up in the paper 's <unk> yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would <unk> putting more than N full-time employees out of work 
 hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for N days 
 some <unk> employees will receive additional benefits the company said 
 hours after the announcement representatives of the orange county register were in a bar across the street recruiting 
 the reaction in the <unk> was emotional 
 i 've never seen so many people <unk> in one place at one time said bill johnson an assistant city editor 
 so long l.a. was chosen as the paper 's final headline 
 i 'm doing the main story and i 'm already two beers drunk said reporter andy <unk> whom the times hired away several years ago but who returned to the herald out of preference 
 his wife also works for the paper as did his father 
 outside a young <unk> filling a news box with an extra edition <unk> herald examiner closes refused to take a reader 's quarter 
 forget it he said as he handed her a paper 
 it does n't make any difference now 
 olympia broadcasting corp. said it did n't make a $ N million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ N million of senior subordinated debentures 
 the <unk> owner and <unk> said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions 
 it said it needs to make the payment by dec. N to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt 
 in september the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business 
 if you 'd really rather have a buick do n't leave home without the american express card 
 or so the <unk> might go 
 american express co. and general motors corp. 's beleaguered buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the american express card 
 the companies are giving four-day <unk> for two to buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the american express green card 
 they have begun sending letters explaining the program which began oct. N and will end dec. N to about five million card holders 
 neither company would disclose the program 's cost 
 buick approached american express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a good credit history and are good at making payments says a spokeswoman for the division 
 american express also represents the upscale image we 're trying to project she adds 
 buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor 's car a product for upscale professionals 
 sales were roughly flat in the N model year compared with a year earlier though industry sales fell 
 but since the N model year began oct. N buick sales have plunged N N 
 for american express the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business 
 traditionally the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses 
 <unk> <unk> an american express executive vice president says the promotion with buick is his company 's first with an auto maker but hopefully will be the first of many in the company 's effort to promote its green card as the total <unk> card 
 to that end american express has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card 
 many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the american express card but few card holders realize this mr. <unk> says 
 until now however buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through general motors acceptance corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with <unk> and state disclosure laws over finance rates says a spokesman for the gm finance arm 
 but gmac approved the buick program he says because the american express green card requires payment in full upon billing and so does n't carry any finance rates 
 mr. <unk> says american express considers gm and buick very sophisticated direct-mail marketers so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability 
 in addition buick is a relatively respected <unk> among american express card holders says an american express spokeswoman 
 when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases buick came in fourth among u.s. cars and in the top N of all cars the spokeswoman says 
 american express has more than N million card holders in the u.s. and over half have the green card 
 gmac <unk> the <unk> list for holders more than N years old with household incomes over $ N who had n't missed any payments the buick spokeswoman says 
 some N million of the five million who will get letters were <unk> for credit with gmac 
 these N million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off gmac 's advertised finance rates which start at N N for two-year loan contracts 
 a spokesman for visa international 's u.s. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards but does n't have plans for a <unk> similar to the american <unk> link 
 three divisions at american express are working with buick on the promotion the establishment services division which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card the travel division and the merchandise sales division 
 the vacation packages include hotel <unk> and in some cases tours or tickets to local <unk> but not meals 
 <unk> are chicago <unk> las vegas nev. los angeles miami beach fla. new orleans new york <unk> fla. san francisco and washington d.c. 
 a buyer who chooses to fly to his <unk> must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on united airlines 
 in <unk> of the vacation buyers can choose among several prizes including a <unk> <unk> or a stereo videocassette recorder 
 card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a <unk> with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes 
 if they <unk> a buick they get an american express <unk> 
 this is n't buick 's first <unk> promotion 
 a few years ago the company offered two <unk> tickets on trans world airlines to buyers of its <unk> luxury car 
 the promotion helped <unk> sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than N N buick said at the time 
 the united kingdom high court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial banks 
 the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the london borough of <unk> and <unk> ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions 
 as many as N u.k. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities 
 an appeal is expected 
 in response to the ruling <unk> futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session 
 <unk> or british government bonds which also fell sharply initially <unk> some of the losses to end about N point lower 
 the council which is alleged to have engaged in over N deals valued at over # N billion $ N billion lost millions of pounds from <unk> swap deals 
 at one point <unk> is reported to have accounted for as much as N N of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings 
 when two parties engage in an interest-rate swap they are betting against each other on future rates 
 thus an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments 
 in most of the british transactions the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks which would make fixed-rate payments 
 as interest rates rose municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them 
 the court hearing began in early october at the request of anthony <unk> district <unk> for <unk> who argued that local <unk> are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such <unk> activities 
 the council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal 
 although the <unk> and <unk> council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such <unk> transactions the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by N other local <unk> 
 while this court ruling was only on <unk> it will obviously be very <unk> in other cases of a similar nature a <unk> representing one of the banks said 
 already N local <unk> have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings 
 other financial institutions involved include barclays bank plc midland bank plc security pacific corp. chemical banking corp. 's chemical bank citicorp 's citibank and mitsubishi finance international 
 if the banks <unk> all <unk> of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the <unk> ruling work both ways some market sources said 
 banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in <unk> where the banks made net payments to <unk> 
 officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable 
 the banks have N days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly 
 in the aftermath of the stock market 's <unk> 190-point drop on oct. N kidder peabody & co. 's N stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and <unk> campaign aimed at <unk> the country 's second-largest program trader 
 the target of their <unk> 
 their own employer kidder peabody 
 since october 's <unk> wall street has been shaken by an explosion of <unk> against program trading the computer-driven <unk> trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes 
 but the <unk> fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market 
 the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards 
 program trading itself according to many <unk> who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace 
 the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market 's sharp fall on oct. N though it may have <unk> it 
 on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in <unk> on wall street the new guard consisting of high-tech computer <unk> at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with <unk> pools of money and the traders at the fast-growing chicago futures exchanges 
 these are the main proponents of program trading 
 defending their <unk> are wall street 's old guard the traditional <unk> money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the new york stock exchange 's listed companies and the <unk> floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks 
 so far wall street 's old guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle successfully <unk> public and congressional opinion to <unk> their <unk> 
 the chicago mercantile exchange a major futures marketplace yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market and the big board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading 
 <unk> by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a <unk> <unk> almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage a common form of program trading for their own accounts in the past few days 
 a few such as giant merrill lynch & co. now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients 
 the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based in part because some old guard members feel their very <unk> is at stake 
 some such as traditional money manager neuberger & <unk> have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators stop the numbers <unk> on wall street 
 big board stock specialists in a bold palace <unk> began shortly after oct. N to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the big board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading 
 charles wohlstetter the chairman of contel corp. who is <unk> other <unk> to the <unk> trading cause says he has received <unk> letters offering support 
 they said <unk> without a single exception do n't even compromise 
 kill it he says 
 wall street 's new guard is n't likely to take all this lying down for long however 
 its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable 
 program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has <unk> them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them 
 what 's more the last time major wall street firms said they were getting out of program trading in the aftermath of the N crash they waited a few months and then <unk> back into it 
 even some members of the old guard despite their current advantage seem to be <unk> that the future belongs with the new guard 
 last week robert m. bradley one of the big board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization surrendered 
 he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. in which he said the big board is too focused on machines rather than people 
 he said the exchange is headed for a real crisis if program trading is n't <unk> 
 i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino mr. bradley wrote 
 the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal <unk> and <unk> employee against employee 
 at kidder a unit of general electric co. and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away 
 corporations like contel <unk> program trading yet contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers trust co. that are also big program traders 
 the big board the nation 's premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives 
 its entrenched N stock specialists firms are fighting <unk> and <unk> against programs 
 but the big board 's leadership over the specialists ' protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock basket product designed to facilitate program trading 
 a lot of people would like to go back to N before program trading mr. phelan said this week 
 i would like to go back to N 
 but we are not going back to N 
 again and again program-trading 's critics raise the casino theme 
 they say greedy market <unk> have made a <unk> of the nation 's <unk> system turning the stock market into a big gambling <unk> with the odds heavily <unk> against the small investor 
 the public did n't come to the market to play a game they can go to <unk> betting for that says a. <unk> murray chairman of <unk> murray foster securities a traditional money management firm 
 the program traders on the other hand <unk> old-fashioned stock pickers as the <unk> of the industry 
 critics like mr. murray are looking for <unk> and people who use computers to trade are a convenient <unk> says j. thomas allen president of advanced investment management inc. a pittsburgh firm that runs a $ N million fund that uses index arbitrage 
 just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to <unk> the regulators for protection 
 for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage the most controversial type of <unk> program trading 
 like other forms of arbitrage it merely seeks to take advantage of <unk> discrepancies in the price of a single product in this case a basket of stocks in different markets in this case the new york stock exchange and the chicago futures markets 
 that divergence is what stock index traders seek 
 when it occurs the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the N stocks that constitute the standard & poor 's N stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market they lock in the difference in price as profit 
 such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds 
 a program trade of $ N million of stock typically earns a <unk> profit of $ N 
 to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers find 
 the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics <unk> to <unk> 
 if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor the odd <unk> mutual funds and pension funds says larry <unk> managing partner at neuberger & <unk> 
 but many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations 
 i have not seen one <unk> of evidence to support restrictions on program trading says a <unk> university finance professor <unk> stoll an authority on the subject 
 says the big board 's mr. phelan volatility is greater than program trading 
 the oct. N plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the <unk> of the $ N billion buy-out of ual corp 
 unable to unload ual and other airline shares takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers dumped every blue-chip stock they had 
 while program trades swiftly kicked in a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible 
 susan del <unk> head trader at travelers investment management co. says critics are ignoring the role the takeover stock <unk> is taking in the market as a source of volatility 
 many <unk> are <unk> she says and they have to sell when things look like they fall apart 
 like virtually everything on wall street the program-trading battle is over money and the <unk> have been losing out on <unk> of it to the new guard in recent years 
 take the traditional money managers or stock pickers as they are <unk> known among the computer <unk> 
 traditional stock managers like to charge N cents to N cents for every $ N they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors 
 yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard <unk> like the s&p 
 not surprisingly <unk> money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to <unk> portfolios so they mirror the s&p N 
 the <unk> charge only a few pennies per $ N managed 
 today about $ N billion or N N of all <unk> stock investments is held by index funds 
 the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make <unk> of the N big board <unk> firms 
 these small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of N N to N N a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks 
 the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death <unk> 
 and they believe the big board under mr. phelan has abandoned their interest 
 the son of a specialist and once one himself mr. phelan has nonetheless been <unk> with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets 
 meanwhile specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility 
 when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go on the big board trading floor says one specialist there 
 the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends 
 no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers 
 they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the N stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then 
 small investors are absolutely <unk> that wall street is <unk> the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death says raymond a. mason chairman of regional broker legg mason inc. in baltimore 
 stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling 
 last year the average broker earned $ N N N lower than in N 
 corporate executives <unk> that their company 's stock has been transformed into a <unk> piece of a stock-index basket 
 index traders who buy all N stocks in the s&p N often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do complains andrew <unk> chairman of champion international corp 
 do you make <unk> or <unk> 
 oh you 're in the paper business is one reaction mr. <unk> says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders 
 by this september program traders were doing a record N N of the big board 's average daily trading volume 
 among the top practitioners were wall street blue <unk> morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc. and painewebber group inc 
 but then came oct. N and the negative publicity <unk> by the old guard particularly against index arbitrage 
 the <unk> ' strategy for the moment is to <unk> down and let the furor die 
 there 's a <unk> psychology right now says the top program-trading official at a wall street firm 
 wall street 's cash <unk> has been <unk> but i do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem 
 too much money is at stake for program traders to give up 
 for example stock-index futures began trading in chicago in N and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched 
 stock futures trading has <unk> dozens of <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> 
 now on a good day chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock 
 now the stage is set for the battle to play out 
 the <unk> are getting some helpful <unk> from congress 
 program traders ' power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way says rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat 
 we have to have a system that says to those largest investors 
 sit down 
 you will not panic 
 you will not put the financial system in jeopardy 
 but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon 
 many people including the big board think that it 's too late to put the <unk> back in the bottle 
 the big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered big board officials say 
 you 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks says <unk> 's prof. stoll 
 program trading is here to stay and computers are here to stay and we just need to understand it 
 short of a total ban some <unk> have proposed several <unk> reforms which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't 
 one such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the <unk> payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks 
 currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly N N compared with N N for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative 
 program trading critics also want the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins 
 futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active 
 higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say 
 another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the great crash of N that protects against stocks being <unk> beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers 
 the big board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price 
 but in N program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets 
 a <unk> of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably 
 program traders argue that a <unk> of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets 
 james a. white contributed to this article 
 <unk> <unk> 
 big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild <unk> swings 
 thus the <unk> psychology of recent days picks up new impetus 
 index arbitrage is a common form of program trading 
 as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same <unk> ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different 
 in index arbitrage the widget is the s&p N and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york 
 to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the s&p N widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p N widget in chicago 
 if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the s&p N index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times 
 few if any <unk> managers will risk <unk> performance by owning more than N N exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a N N position should stocks rise 
 by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope to add between N N and N N to the annual return of the s&p N 
 that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective 
 the fact that a vast majority of <unk> money managers fail to beat the s&p N may contribute to the <unk> surrounding the issue 
 as more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated 
 the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the s&p N is more <unk> than <unk> in the futures market 
 the new york stock exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' <unk> to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares 
 so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin <unk> between two markets for the same widget how did program trading <unk> into the evil <unk> that is <unk> the <unk> of so many observers 
 all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented N reduced volatility N a long-term investment focus and N a level playing field for the small investor 
 but many of these reforms are <unk> even harmful 
 reducing volatility 
 an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs 
 arbitrage does n't cause volatility it <unk> to it 
 think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p N stocks usually it is large investors <unk> a buy or sell in chicago 
 a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures 
 arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york while <unk> as a buyer in chicago 
 the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in <unk> to make widget prices move 
 why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york 
 perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade 
 in a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle 
 if not chicago then in new york if not the u.s. then overseas 
 volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or <unk> to a widget market with <unk> liquidity 
 eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less 
 the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not <unk> 
 if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone <unk> should become the trade ticket of the future 
 encouraging long-term investing 
 we must be very cautious about <unk> investors as long-term or short-term 
 policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are <unk> to placing a sign over the big board 's door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away 
 the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term 
 a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can <unk> 
 in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today 
 periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were <unk> change N N and N for example 
 it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers <unk> <unk> on program trading when the markets decline while <unk> the great values still <unk> as the markets rise 
 could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil <unk> of program-trading <unk> 
 some of the proposed <unk> for what is labeled program-trading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem 
 in using program trading as a <unk> boy <unk> investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing <unk> products 
 they may however risk bringing some damaging <unk> from outside the markets themselves 
 how does a nice new tax say N N on any financial transaction sound 
 that ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term 
 getting a level playing field 
 this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for <unk> program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms <unk> the cause 
 the <unk> of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors 
 they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance 
 even with mutual funds the little investor continues to <unk> high fees high commissions and poor performance while <unk> managers slowly <unk> a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk 
 yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert <unk> <unk> press <unk> on each company he follows 
 almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences 
 if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors 
 the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue <unk> performers first while leaving institutions to <unk> with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter 
 <unk> index funds just are n't <unk> enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay 
 each new trading <unk> is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their <unk> clients here or overseas 
 <unk> new trading <unk> will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors 
 so what is next for program trading 
 left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder to do profitably 
 spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit 
 if government or private <unk> insist however on introducing greater <unk> between the markets limits on price moves <unk> execution higher margin requirements taxation etc. the end loser will be the markets themselves 
 instead we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants

 some democrats in congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years 
 the funding mechanism which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by president bush would affect the antitrust operations of the justice department and the federal trade commission 
 as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending congress cut by $ N million the bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N which began oct. N 
 to offset the reduction congress approved a $ N fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions 
 some democrats led by rep. jack brooks d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts 
 but justice department and ftc officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them 
 it could operate to <unk> our budget james <unk> the justice department 's antitrust chief said in an interview 
 under measures approved by both houses of congress the administration 's request for $ N million for the antitrust division would be cut $ N million 
 the ftc budget request of $ N million about $ N million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by $ N million 
 the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N as was appropriated in fiscal N 
 the offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the hart-scott-rodino act 
 under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ N million or more must notify ftc and justice department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions 
 currently the government charges nothing for such filings 
 proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than N a year the fees will yield at least $ N million this fiscal year or $ N million more than the budget cuts 
 when you do that there is not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of $ N million each for the ftc and the justice department rep. neal smith d. iowa said during house debate 
 but rep. don edwards d. calif responded that a recession could <unk> merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected 
 the antitrust staffs of both the ftc and justice department were cut more than N N in the reagan administration and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period 
 today is not the time to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen mr. edwards argued 
 any money in excess of $ N million collected from the fees in fiscal N would go to the treasury at large 
 corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions 
 though some lawyers reported that prospective <unk> were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings

 researchers at american telephone & telegraph co. 's bell laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of N moving the materials closer to commercial use 
 the scientists said they created small changes in the <unk> structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to N <unk> per square <unk> in a moderately strong magnetic field 
 the scientists said they made the advance with <unk> superconductors cooled to <unk> <unk> or minus N degrees <unk> 
 their report appears in today 's issue of the journal nature 
 the finding marks a significant step in research on bulk superconductors which are aimed at use in wires for motors <unk> <unk> and other applications 
 scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry 
 superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled 
 a family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised 
 the at&t advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome 
 but it wo n't lead to imminent use of new superconductors cautioned robert b. van dover one of the at&t researchers 
 he added that the current-carrying capacity of <unk> samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals 
 such <unk> materials will probably be needed for commercial applications 
 mr. van dover said the at&t team created the <unk> crystal changes by <unk> superconductor samples with neutrons a process that creates some <unk> in the samples and may not be <unk> for large-scale commercial use 
 still scientists <unk> a collective sigh of relief about the finding because it demonstrates how to overcome the <unk> <unk> problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as <unk> new superconductors ' potential 
 the problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals limiting their current-carrying capacity 
 mr. van dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently <unk> the magnetic fields in place preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity 
 mr. van dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem 
 determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed <unk> patterns 
 the at&t team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with <unk> growth a process discovered earlier at bell laboratories 
 the combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of <unk> samples

 although his team lost the world series san francisco giants owner bob <unk> hopes to have a new home for them 
 he is an <unk> fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for candlestick park 
 small wonder since he 's asking san francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ N million into the new stadium 
 as san francisco digs out from the pretty big one opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium 
 a stadium craze is sweeping the country 
 it 's fueled by the increasing profitability of <unk> teams 
 something like one-third of the nation 's N largest cities are thinking about new stadiums ranging from cleveland to san antonio and st. <unk> 
 most <unk> claim the new sports <unk> will be <unk> for their city 
 <unk> university economist dean <unk> <unk> at that 
 he has looked at N baseball and football stadiums and found that only one private <unk> stadium brought more money into a city than it took out 
 stadiums tend to <unk> existing wealth within a community not create more of it 
 voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new <unk> 
 san francisco voters rejected a new <unk> two years ago 
 last month phoenix voters turned <unk> down on a $ N million stadium bond and tax proposition 
 its backers <unk> every important interest on their team a popular mayor the chamber of commerce the major media and spent $ N on promotion 
 but voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself and rejected it N N to N N 
 in san francisco its backers concede the <unk> is at best running even in the polls 
 george christopher the former san francisco mayor who built candlestick park for the giants in the 1960s wo n't <unk> the new <unk> 
 he says he had candlestick built because the giants claimed they needed N parking <unk> 
 since the new park will have only N <unk> mr. christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal games of their own with the voters 
 stadium <unk> claim that without public money they would never be built 
 miami <unk> owner joe <unk> <unk> and he can prove it

 this stadium shows that anything government can do we can do better mr. <unk> says 
 but to moon <unk> the former new orleans mayor who helped build that city 's <unk> money-losing <unk> questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little <unk> 
 the <unk> is an exercise in optimism a statement of faith he has said 
 it is the very building of it that is important not how much of it is used or its economics 
 an egyptian <unk> could n't have justified his <unk> any better

 wall street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered 
 the reason risks from the firms ' new merchant banking activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business <unk> 
 the downgrading of debt issued by cs first boston inc. parent of first boston corp. by moody 's investors service inc. coupled with a moody 's announcement that shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. is under review for a possible downgrade sent <unk> through the brokerage community this week 
 with the <unk> came the <unk> that some of wall street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the <unk> credit standing required to finance their activities profitably 
 securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or short-term corporate <unk> which they sell to finance their daily operations 
 the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper 
 but moody 's warned that shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon a move that would reduce shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms 
 shearson is <unk> by american express co 
 just as the 1980s bull market transformed the u.s. securities business so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s says christopher t. <unk> a moody 's vice president 
 a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible 
 standard & poor 's corp. says first boston shearson and drexel burnham lambert inc. in particular are likely to have difficulty <unk> up their credit standing in months ahead 
 what worries <unk> concerns the most is that wall street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings 
 that 's a departure from their traditional practice of <unk> almost all financing risks to investors 
 <unk> conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly wall street 's new <unk> for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years 
 the recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays in getting their money back says jeffrey <unk> a vice president at s&p which raised a warning flag for the industry in april when it downgraded cs first boston 
 wall street is facing a <unk> situation says mr. <unk> of moody 's 
 merchant banking where firms commit their own money is getting riskier and there 's less of it to go around 
 in addition he says the buy-out business is under pressure because of the junk bond collapse meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings <unk> 
 in a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets 
 in a recent report moody 's said it expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry which combined with overcapacity will create poor prospects for profitability 
 it said that the temptation for <unk> to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor 
 both moody 's and s&p cited first boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit 
 the recent cash squeeze at campeau corp. first boston 's most lucrative client of the decade is proving costly to first boston because it arranged more than $ N billion of high-yield high-risk junk financings for campeau units 
 in addition a big loan that first boston made to ohio <unk> co was n't repaid on time when its $ N million junk financing for a buy-out of the <unk> company was withdrawn 
 these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of cs first boston 's equity moody 's said 
 total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity 
 cs first boston however benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder credit suisse switzerland 's third largest bank 
 shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business 
 but its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail or individual investor business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the october N stock market crash 
 in addition shearson 's listed $ N billion of capital is <unk> according to the rating concerns because it includes $ N billion of goodwill 
 shearson really only has $ N million of capital says mr. <unk> of s&p 
 a shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried 
 a year ago moody 's also had shearson under review for possible downgrade he said 
 after two months of talks our rating was maintained 
 drexel meanwhile already competes at a disadvantage to its big wall street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating 
 the collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held drexel the leading underwriter in that market 
 the firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six <unk> related to a big insider-trading scandal 
 drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business cutting the firm 's <unk> almost in half to just over N 
 recently drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years 
 the firm 's capital moreover has n't grown at the same rate as in the past officials at these firms say 
 drexel remains confident of its future <unk> 
 we 're well positioned with $ N billion of capital a drexel spokesman said 
 and as a leading investment and merchant banking firm the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and <unk> of the retail business is a major plus in our view 
 moreover we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs which are down around N N over the last six months 
 lewis c. <unk> the father of the team that created the highly successful ford <unk> and mercury <unk> cars retired early after experiencing recent heart problems 
 most recently mr. <unk> N years old has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co 
 but he is best known in the auto industry as the <unk> of a team <unk> approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the no. N auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's ford division to <unk> general motors corp. 's chevrolet division as the <unk> <unk> in the u.s. 
 under the so-called team <unk> approach mr. <unk> and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers <unk> workers auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle 
 the concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands 
 it was later applied to other <unk> programs including those that produced the ford <unk> and mercury <unk> 
 ford chairman donald e. <unk> said yesterday that mr. <unk> has helped to change the world 's perception of <unk> cars 
 mr. <unk> worked at ford for N years holding a variety of car and <unk> positions 
 the limits to legal <unk> stretched another <unk> this week when the supreme court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm 
 we can understand and share the <unk> that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of <unk> aid to those who 've been hurt 
 but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional <unk> process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk technology and innovation 
 too often now a single court decision becomes the precedent for other less compelling cases 
 from the <unk> until N some two million women took the synthetic <unk> <unk> des to prevent <unk> and morning <unk> 
 the drug was approved by the food and drug administration and marketed by some N pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels 
 in the 1970s scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users 
 the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used 
 beginning in N courts in several states including california and new york decided to suspend the <unk> rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable 
 courts made the assumption that all des pills were essentially the same and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales 
 this has some logic 
 drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used 
 but courts quickly tumbled down a <unk> <unk> 
 just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different <unk> 
 the ultimate result came in <unk> v. lilly where the highest new york court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove <unk> <unk> 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages 
 but as duke university law professor william van <unk> notes by this <unk> a defendant could be held liable in new york for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in california 
 despite the supreme court 's refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and <unk> <unk> from the defendants 
 the big problem however is that there 's no guarantee that this <unk> will be limited to des or to drugs 
 the problem here goes well beyond <unk> legal doctrine 
 the california supreme court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win des cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has <unk> the introduction of new drugs 
 the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs citing the huge hidden social costs 
 public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might <unk> their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering the <unk> court said 
 the california justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining <unk> drug <unk> off the u.s. market 
 this raises the key issue what to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs 
 we now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone 
 as liability expert peter <unk> tells us after the <unk> case if any drug maker <unk> an <unk> drug it 's time to sell that company 's stock short 
 we also know that the <unk> system is a <unk> way to compensate victims anyway some win the legal <unk> others get much less and <unk> lawyers take a big cut either way 
 des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts 
 congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs 
 but a N law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's <unk> with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation 
 everyone by now understands that congress is utterly <unk> of writing legislation to help <unk> people without its becoming some billion-dollar <unk> 
 we have no doubt this is one reason judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing to trash the law in the des cases 
 they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody but know it wo n't be done by congress

 n.v <unk> said net income in the third quarter jumped N N as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program 
 the dutch chemical group said net income gained to N million guilders $ N million or N guilders a share from N million guilders or N guilders a share a year ago 
 the N N state-owned <unk> had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations 
 the charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division 
 last year <unk> had N million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions 
 the earnings growth also was fueled by the company 's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around N million guilders 
 also substantially lower dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax <unk> flat relative to earnings growth the company added 
 sales however were little changed at N billion guilders compared with N billion guilders

 it is these N tons that are in question for this crop year explained <unk> <unk> analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york 
 producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued yesterday 
 as a result ms. <unk> said it is believed that little or no sugar from the N crop has been shipped yet even though the crop year is six months old 
 more than a half of all sugar produced in brazil goes for alcohol production according to ms. <unk> 
 also there has been a switch in the past decade to <unk> of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane and this change is being felt now she said 
 most important ms. <unk> noted brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports 
 thomas <unk> sugar analyst for painewebber in <unk> n.j. said i am highly skeptical that brazil will curtail sugar exports particularly with the price of sugar at over N cents a pound 
 above all mr. <unk> noted the situation is extremely confused 
 professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation he said 
 it 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out such as the one saying exports will be suspended and no one can confirm it 
 mr. <unk> observed that the situation in brazil is also very complicated 
 on the one hand brazil started an <unk> program about N years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program 
 it has to weigh on the other hand the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol mr. <unk> said 
 mexico which is normally a sugar exporter has had production problems in the past two years analysts said 
 last year it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments they noted

 junk-bond <unk> an ongoing securities and exchange commission investigation a drexel burnham lambert connection a <unk> buy-out rumor 
 all this has cast a pall over columbia savings & loan association and its <unk> <unk> chairman thomas spiegel who built the $ N billion beverly hills calif. thrift with high-yield junk bonds 
 bears have targeted columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market 
 and some investors fault mr. spiegel 's life style he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in columbia 's jet planes 
 columbia stock recently hit N N after reaching N N earlier this year on rumors that mr. spiegel would take the thrift private 
 moreover junk professionals think columbia 's huge third-quarter <unk> of its junk portfolio to $ N billion was n't enough meaning another <unk> could be coming 
 but in recent days columbia has edged up closing at N N up N yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure 
 mr. spiegel 's fans say columbia 's southern california branches are highly <unk> and the thrift has $ N million of shareholders equity underlying its assets 
 that 's almost $ N of equity for each columbia share including convertible preferred shares though more junk <unk> would reduce the cushion 
 columbia has only about N million common shares in public hands 
 the spiegel family has N N of the common and N N of the votes 
 other big common holders are carl <unk> 's american financial investor <unk> jacobs and pacific financial research though the latter cut its stake this summer 
 while many problems would attend a restructuring of columbia investors say mr. spiegel is <unk> such a plan to <unk> columbia 's junk problems 
 indeed columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking 
 columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation 
 but like other thrifts it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity 
 plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so 
 new rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value then sell the bonds over five years 
 that 's why columbia just wrote off $ N million of its junk and reserved $ N million for future junk losses 
 but if columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature at full value unless the issuer goes <unk> or <unk> the junk portfolio might do all right 
 columbia a longtime drexel client wo n't provide current data on its junk 
 but its N big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered 
 these were allied stores western union telegraph gillett holdings sci television and texas air though many other bonds in columbia 's portfolio also have lost value 
 possibly offsetting that columbia recently estimated it has <unk> gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ N million 
 it also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ N million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings 
 one trial balloon mr. spiegel is said to have <unk> to investors columbia might be broken up as mellon bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank 
 but columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift while the bad bank would be a private investment company holding some of columbia 's junk bonds real estate and equity investments 
 some think columbia 's thrift which now is seeking a new chief operating officer might be capitalized at say $ N million and <unk> to a commercial bank that wants a california presence 
 the thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity financial industry executives say 
 meanwhile the bad bank with the junk bonds and some capital might be spun off to columbia shareholders including mr. spiegel who might then have a new career investors say 
 it is n't clear how much a restructuring would help columbia stockholders 
 but the concept is <unk> 
 you sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank says thrift specialist lewis <unk> of <unk> associates in new york 
 mr. spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on wall street 
 few people think mr. spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift which current rules would force columbia to become 
 they are n't really a thrift says jonathan gray a sanford c. bernstein analyst 
 of course regulators would have to approve columbia 's reorganization 
 and some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't <unk> while the sec still is <unk> mr. spiegel 's past junk-bond trades

 the bush administration 's nomination of <unk> thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the american bar association gave mr. thomas only a qualified rating rather than well qualified 
 people familiar with the senate judiciary committee which will vote on the nomination said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the aba rating in hearings on the matter 
 mr. thomas currently chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court 
 groups have accused him of <unk> policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies 
 <unk> members of the house with jurisdiction over the <unk> have said they oppose mr. thomas 's nomination because of serious questions about his judgment and respect for the law 
 a senior justice department official however said the administration is n't worried about the aba rating 
 we 're pleased the aba rated him qualified david runkel the department 's chief spokesman said in an interview 
 the aba gives a qualified rating to <unk> it believes would perform <unk> on the bench

 the move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units the company said 
 <unk> had N sales of N million marks $ N million and has a current order backlog of N billion marks 
 the sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of <unk> stock 
 a plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of frankfurt share prices 
 the u.s. international trade commission issued preliminary rulings under the u.s. <unk> act that imports of <unk> from hong kong taiwan and south korea may be <unk> a domestic industry 
 because of the rulings the commerce department will continue to investigate complaints by u.s. <unk> makers that the imports are reaching the u.s. at unfairly low prices in violation of the u.s. <unk> act 
 the law <unk> unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market 
 <unk> officials said final commerce department and <unk> rulings wo n't come until next march or later

 upjohn co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as N employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge 
 upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees and how many will participate in the retirement plan 
 but the pharmaceutical company said it anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's <unk> will more than offset short-term costs 
 the program available to upjohn employees N years old or older could increase an individual 's retirement benefits N N to N N 
 in addition upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay 
 chairman <unk> <unk> called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and an effective <unk> program 
 but some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have because few jobs will end up being eliminated 
 it 's a cosmetic move said jonathan s. <unk> of wertheim schroder & co 
 according to upjohn 's estimates only N N to N N of the N eligible employees will take advantage of the plan 
 upjohn further estimated that about N N of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced 
 as a result upjohn will likely trim only about N to N of its more than N jobs world-wide 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday upjohn shares rose N cents to $ N apiece 
 an upjohn spokesman said he had heard nothing to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation 
 the company earlier this year adopted a <unk> plan to ward off unwanted suitors 
 the spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year <unk> strategy

 although started in N wedtech did n't really get rolling until N when mr. neuberger discovered the federal government 's section N a minority business program 
 this is a <unk> great society creation that <unk> certain government contracts be awarded <unk> to minority businesses 
 mr. neuberger realized that although of italian <unk> mr. <unk> still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in puerto rico 
 the two partners merely had to <unk> the true ownership of the corporation 
 instead of N it became on paper only two-thirds <unk> one-third neuberger and they were in the program and off to the races 
 besides being a <unk> company wedtech was located in the south bronx a <unk> area made famous by <unk> carter in his N presidential campaign

 starting with congressman mario <unk> now serving a jail sentence the company began a career of <unk> federal state and local public officials and those close to public officials right up to and including e. robert <unk> close friend and adviser to former attorney general ed <unk> 
 wedtech did n't just use old <unk> bribery

 numerous other scandals among them the ones at hud have the same <unk> as wedtech 
 they take place in government programs that seem <unk> for corruption 
 why are programs like this not eliminated 
 feeding frenzy does provide a few clues 
 in and around all levels of government in the u.s. are groups of people who can best be described as <unk> to a political insider commercial party 
 they know that whenever government is <unk> wealth <unk> commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment there is big money to be made in <unk> <unk> or selling the processes and decisions of government 
 they are our version of the east bloc 's <unk> and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change 
 how many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders

 the battery plant which makes <unk> nickel <unk> and carbon <unk> products will be closed over the next year or so a spokesman said

 the record <unk> binge by the soviet union is causing serious <unk> in the u.s. grain pipeline 
 the soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river <unk> and trains to move the recently <unk> midwest crop to ports for <unk> onto soviet ships 
 river <unk> rates have soared N N this fall from a year earlier 
 railroad companies and some ports are <unk> a sudden <unk> of business 
 and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might <unk> this month as exporters <unk> to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the soviets 
 the soviet union bought roughly N million <unk> of u.s. corn in october which is the most ever sold to the soviet union in one month from the u.s. 
 the soviet union wants much of it delivered by january which would be a strain in most years 
 but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the mississippi river on which flows much of the u.s. corn that is shipped overseas 
 we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record said william <unk> a u.s. agriculture department transportation expert 
 it is going to be real tight 
 because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains the water level on the upper section of the mississippi river is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of <unk> their <unk> push at one time 
 in a few weeks many <unk> probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of st. louis because the u.s. army corps of engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the missouri river which feeds into the mississippi river 
 the army corps is cutting the flow of the missouri river about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the <unk> that feed it 
 <unk> rates on the mississippi river sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation 
 but the army corps of engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month 
 at st. louis the water level of the mississippi river is already N feet below normal and it could drop an additional N feet when the flow of the missouri river is slowed an army corps spokesman said 
 similar levels <unk> <unk> shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in N years 
 so far the grain industry 's <unk> <unk> problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the chicago board of trade 
 many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers 
 at the board of trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for december delivery slipped N cents a bushel to settle at $ N a bushel 
 corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the <unk> <unk> by the N drought 
 with the harvest <unk> down however some analysts are <unk> that prices might jump in some regions as u.s. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver 
 farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices 
 because the drought reduced u.s. <unk> they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices to rise 
 in parts of iowa for example some grain elevators are offering farmers $ N a bushel for corn 
 many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least N cents a bushel said <unk> reed president of chicago central & pacific railroad co. of <unk> iowa 
 it is n't clear however who would win a waiting game 
 although u.s. corn <unk> shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought the agriculture department projects that nearly <unk> of the harvest will still be in storage before the N corn harvest begins 
 some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts only to see little appreciation 
 the public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped said bill <unk> <unk> inc. research director 
 although much of this country 's export corn goes to new orleans by <unk> it is possible for exporters to <unk> the mississippi river by shipping a <unk> amount of corn by train to the port 
 ports in the great <unk> and atlantic coast can also relieve pressure on new orleans 
 one railroad for example is already increasing its grain <unk> service from indiana to baltimore 
 and it is n't clear that the soviet union will stay on its record buying pace 
 the soviet orders were <unk> into the month of october because of delays 
 the soviet union usually begins buying u.s. crops earlier in the fall 
 but its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems

 precious metals gold in particular currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability according to william <unk> vice president of research at elders futures in new york 
 the recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities he said 
 yesterday the stock market rose strongly creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders he said 
 silver and platinum which have more of an industrial nature than gold were even weaker he said 
 silver is also under pressure of extremely high inventories in warehouses of the commodity exchange he said 
 yesterday these stocks rose by N ounces to a record of N ounces according to an exchange spokesman 
 copper futures prices partially recovered monday 's declines because <unk> miners voted to strike 
 the december contract rose N cents a pound to $ N 
 in chile workers at two copper mines los <unk> and el <unk> which belong to the <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow an analyst said 
 reasons for the <unk> the analyst said included a number of procedural issues such as a right to strike 
 the analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks 
 in the case of copper he said the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal 
 also contributing to the <unk> in copper the analyst noted was a report by chicago purchasing agents which <unk> the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold 
 the purchasing management association of chicago 's october index rose to N N after three previous months of <unk> below N N 
 the september index was N N 
 a reading below N N generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy while a reading above N N points to expansion 
 the chicago report raised the possibility that the october survey of the national association of purchasing management would also show a reading above N N

 usx corp. posted a N N drop in third-quarter profit as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations 
 the nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share 
 the recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ N million from asset sales while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ N million 
 in the N period usx also had a $ N million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing 
 however third-quarter operating profit fell N N as usx sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments eliminating income from those operations 
 among segments that continue to operate though the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its <unk> goods serving the oil industry and other markets 
 peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc. said that a downturn in the <unk> industry coupled with sluggish automotive sales hurt usx results 
 moreover usx exports more than other steelmakers and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure 
 the company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the <unk> ohio plant which now is a N joint venture with japan 's kobe steel ltd 
 in the steel division operating profit dropped N N to $ N million 
 profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ N a ton from $ N a ton last year and $ N a ton in the second quarter analysts said 
 still usx fared better than other major steelmakers earning more per ton of steel shipped than either bethlehem steel corp. which posted a N N drop in net income or inland steel industries inc. whose profit plummeted N N 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday usx shares closed up $ N at $ N as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales 
 the rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that usx 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' 
 charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said usx may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year 
 he said usx also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet than <unk> structural goods 
 the energy segment with a N N rise in operating profit is clearly the company 's strongest 
 higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the marathon oil co. unit to $ N million from $ N million

 proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares 
 the company noted that it has reduced debt by $ N billion since the end of N and bought back about N million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of N 
 usx has about $ N billion in long-term debt and N million shares outstanding 
 the announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor carl icahn had increased his stake in usx to N N and threatened a takeover or other business combination 
 mr. icahn has said he believes usx would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments

 professors philip <unk> of the university of chicago and laurence tribe of harvard law school said any effort by president bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would <unk> the text of the constitution and the intent of its authors as well as the views of previous presidents 
 a line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure 
 mr. bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure 
 a white house spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the constitution <unk> gives him the authority for a line-item veto to <unk> a test case 
 but the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. wrote in a joint letter that the president lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto 
 the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum mr. <unk> is a conservative and mr. tribe is a liberal 
 the two professors said the constitution <unk> the president to veto entire bills not partial measures 
 moreover they said the first appropriations bill passed N years ago covered many different items and there was no discussion of a line-item veto 
 they also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the civil war and all have shared the view that such <unk> power is beyond the reach of the president 
 sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power but that it would be a reckless course of action for president bush to claim the authority without congressional approval

 a sec proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the <unk> of information on insider trades as a <unk> tool individual investors and professional money managers contend 
 they make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that among other things would exempt many <unk> executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares 
 the proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often 
 many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the N stock market crash and the markets already so <unk> against the little guy that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether 
 the sec has historically paid <unk> to the ideal of a level playing field wrote <unk> s. <unk> of <unk> ill. in one of the N letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed aug. N 
 apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal 
 currently the rules force executives directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction 
 but about N N of the insiders according to sec figures file their reports late 
 the changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives who are really calling the shots said brian lane special counsel at the sec 's office of disclosure policy which proposed the changes 
 investors money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory mr. lane said 
 the sec will probably vote on the proposal early next year he said 
 not all those who wrote oppose the changes 
 the committee on federal regulation of securities for the american bar association argues for example in its lengthy letter to the sec that the proposed changes would substantially improve the law by <unk> it more closely to contemporary business realities 
 what the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot <unk> <unk> of trading activity buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time 
 according to some estimates the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third 
 the sec 's mr. lane <unk> disputed those estimates 
 the rules will eliminate filings <unk> divisions such as sales marketing finance and research and development mr. lane said 
 the proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports he said 
 companies would be <unk> to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time 
 considered as a whole mr. lane said the filings required under the proposed rules will be at least as effective if not more so for investors following transactions 
 but robert <unk> president of <unk> a north miami fla. company that packages and sells the insider-trading data said the proposal is <unk> so <unk> that key officials may fail to file the reports 
 many investors wrote asking the sec to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately not a month later 
 but mr. lane said that while the sec <unk> who files the law tells them when to do so 
 investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in congress he added 
 the sec would likely be <unk> to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis he said 
 the nation 's largest pension fund which oversees $ N billion for college employees plans to offer two new investment options to its N million participants 
 the teachers insurance and annuity <unk> retirement equities fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in <unk> responsible companies and a bond fund 
 both funds are expected to begin operation around march N subject to securities and exchange commission approval 
 for its employees to sign up for the options a college also must approve the plan 
 some N institutions are part of the pension fund 
 the new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options reached with the sec in december 
 the new social choice fund will <unk> securities of companies linked to south africa nuclear power and in some cases northern ireland

 the bond fund will invest in high-grade or <unk> bonds mortgages or asset-backed securities including as much as N N in foreign securities 
 the fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts subject to approval by the new york state insurance department 
 under two new features participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or if their jobs are terminated receive cash from the funds

 solo <unk> players have to be creative if they want to work a lot because their <unk> and audience appeal are limited 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> has taken a hard line about the problem he commissions and <unk> <unk> <unk> contemporary scores and does some conducting so he does n't have to play the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> over and over again 
 richard stoltzman has taken a <unk> more <unk> approach 
 years ago he <unk> with the new music <unk> peter <unk> and fred <unk> in the very <unk> chamber group <unk> which won audiences over to <unk> contemporary scores like <unk> 's <unk> for the end of time 
 today the <unk> <unk> has mostly dropped the <unk> work though a touch of the old <unk> still <unk> and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a <unk> that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions 
 just the thing for the <unk> set the <unk> audience that has embraced new age as its very own easy listening 
 but you ca n't dismiss mr. stoltzman 's music or his <unk> as merely commercial and <unk> 
 he believes in what he plays and he plays <unk> 
 his recent appearance at the metropolitan museum dubbed a musical <unk> was a case in point 
 it felt more like a party or a highly <unk> <unk> session with a few friends than a classical concert 
 <unk> in his trademark black <unk> suit the <unk> <unk> announced that his new <unk> inner voices had just been released that his family was in the front row and that it was his mother 's birthday so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record 
 he launched into <unk> 's the <unk> from carnival of the animals a favorite <unk> piece for <unk> with lovely glossy tone and no <unk> 
 then as if to show that he could play fast as well he offered the second movement from <unk> 's <unk> for <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that reflected the <unk> side of the stoltzman <unk> 
 and so it went through the first half an <unk> chosen <unk> of pieces none longer than five minutes none that would <unk> or challenge a <unk> 
 mr. stoltzman introduced his colleagues bill douglas <unk> and an old buddy from yale and jazz <unk> eddie <unk> 
 an <unk> section was built around pieces by mr. douglas beginning with golden rain a <unk> <unk> lead in to the <unk> sky which gave mr. stoltzman the opportunity to <unk> in a high register and show off his fleet fingers 
 <unk> 's air followed 
 mr. stoltzman tied the <unk> in by <unk> him the great <unk> of the <unk> century and then built on the image by joining with mr. douglas in some <unk> two-part <unk> <unk> arranged for <unk> and <unk> by mr. douglas 
 keeping the mood light the two then <unk> and <unk> their way through some <unk> <unk> devised by mr. douglas as an alternative to <unk> 's dry <unk> techniques and then with mr. <unk> soared and <unk> on the <unk> 's tight <unk> <unk> 
 the end of the first half however brought what the <unk> crowd seemed to be waiting for the pop singer <unk> collins who appears on inner voices 
 glamorous and <unk> as ever ms. collins sang <unk> mitchell 's for free about an <unk> with a <unk> <unk> to which mr. stoltzman contributed a <unk> <unk> and mr. douglas 's <unk> setting of a <unk> blessing deep peace 
 deep peace also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds <unk> <unk> <unk> etc 
 it was all too <unk> to be believed but they probably would have gotten away with it had they not felt <unk> to add ms. collins 's signature tune amazing grace and ask for audience participation 
 that went over the permissible line for warm and <unk> feelings 
 was this why some of the audience <unk> before or during the second half 
 or was it because ms. collins had gone 
 either way it was a <unk> because mr. <unk> offered the most substantial music of the evening just after <unk> steve reich 's new york <unk> one of a series of reich works that <unk> a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing 
 mr. reich 's new different trains for string <unk> uses the technique <unk> 
 mr. stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it he warned us in advance that new york <unk> lasts N N minutes 
 he also unfortunately illustrated this <unk> <unk> <unk> with mr. <unk> 's images this time of <unk> or <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of the musical structure that was <unk> <unk> from mr. reich 's piece and mr. stoltzman 's elegant execution of it 
 the rest of the concert was more straight jazz and <unk> sounds written by charlie parker <unk> coleman bill douglas and eddie <unk> with pictures for the douglas pieces 
 it was <unk> to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a <unk> club but like the first half much of it was easy to take and ultimately <unk> 
 is this the future of chamber music 
 managers and <unk> insist that chamber music <unk> are a hard sell but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is <unk> of threatening elements served up in <unk> <unk> and accompanied by <unk> 
 what 's next 
 <unk> to illustrate <unk> <unk> 
 it was not an <unk> evening certainly thanks to the high level of performance the <unk> <unk> of mr. douglas and the obvious <unk> with which mr. stoltzman chooses his <unk> 
 but it was neither deep nor lasting light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of <unk> 
 ms. <unk> is a free-lance writer based in new york 
 one of ronald reagan 's attributes as president was that he rarely gave his blessing to the <unk> that passes for consensus in various international institutions 
 in fact he <unk> the u.s. from one of the world 's most corrupt organizations unesco 
 this is the u.n. group that managed to <unk> its own charter of promoting education science and culture 
 ever since the remaining members have been desperate for the united states to <unk> this <unk> group 
 now unesco <unk> are lobbying president bush to <unk> on president reagan 's decision to <unk> 
 but we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond 
 the u.s. along with britain and singapore left the agency when its <unk> <unk> financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand 
 the personal <unk> of agency director <unk> <unk> drew much attention such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as kgb plants and <unk> from france and when a <unk> office fire was set just before congress sent accountants to <unk> u.s. funds 
 mr. <unk> was an extreme case but even his replacement the more personally <unk> spanish <unk> <unk> mayor has had little success at <unk> reforms 
 several ridiculous projects continue including the new international economic order which means <unk> from the west to pay for everyone else 's <unk> 
 the <unk> new world information order would give government officials rights against the press journalists would be obliged to <unk> to their government which would have licensing and censorship powers and indeed duties to block printing of wrong ideas 
 unesco somehow converted the founding u.n. <unk> of individual rights and liberty into peoples ' rights 
 <unk> conferences were held to <unk> on subjects such as ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of <unk> and the impact of the activities of <unk> corporations 
 the agency was so totally <unk> from the high principles of its founding that even the soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so <unk> to them 
 glasnost may be partly responsible but soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze last year admitted the <unk> ideological approach undermined <unk> <unk> to unesco 
 unesco is now holding its <unk> meetings in paris to devise its next projects 
 mr. mayor 's hope that <unk> to press freedom would survive <unk> seems doomed to failure the current <unk> is <unk> the public and media to avoid manipulation 
 he has n't been able to replace the <unk> <unk> 
 soviets remain in charge of education programs a former head of an african military <unk> for executions is in charge of culture and a hard-line polish communist in <unk> directs the human-rights and peace division 
 of the agency 's N staff members N are in the field working on actual projects such as <unk> and <unk> research 
 the position of the united states which once contributed N N of the budget is that nothing has changed 
 john <unk> the assistant secretary of state for international organizations told congress that the continuing <unk> restrictive <unk> programs make <unk> any time soon extremely unlikely 
 this has n't much bothered the unesco delegates who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy <unk> french <unk> the agency somehow owns 
 other countries including west germany may have a hard time <unk> continued membership 
 we see an even stronger argument against unesco than its <unk> failure to reform 
 this is that the reagan revolution <unk> eastern europe and <unk> square shows the power of ideas <unk> by international civil <unk> or government <unk> 
 free markets free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get <unk> only when delivered through u.n. organizations which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home 
 the <unk> of the united nations are experts at <unk> 
 this can have its purposes at times but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and <unk> of western <unk> of freedom and justice 
 we can see plenty of reasons to stay out and none to <unk> unesco 
 researchers at plant genetic systems n.v. in belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops 
 the researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of <unk> 
 the gene thus can prevent a plant from <unk> itself 
 such so-called <unk> plants can then be <unk> by <unk> from another strain of the plant thereby producing hybrid seed 
 the new generation of plants will <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as hybrid <unk> similar to that now seen in hybrid corn 
 the development could have a dramatic effect on farm production especially cotton said murray robinson president of delta & <unk> land co. a <unk> inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the u.s. 
 on a commercial scale the <unk> of the <unk> male part has only been achieved in corn and <unk> feed grains 
 that 's because the male part the <unk> and the female the <unk> are some distance apart on the corn plant 
 in a <unk> process the seed companies cut off the <unk> of each plant making it male <unk> 
 they <unk> a row of <unk> plants nearby which then <unk> the <unk> plants 
 the first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as N N more corn than naturally <unk> plants 
 the vast majority of the u.s. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies 
 a similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops such as cotton soybeans and rice 
 the male part the <unk> of the plant and the female the <unk> of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other 
 the <unk> in these plants are difficult to <unk> off 
 in china a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male <unk> of rice plants using <unk> and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds 
 at plant genetic systems researchers have isolated a <unk> gene that can be inserted in a plant to <unk> male <unk> 
 jan <unk> research director said this gene was successfully introduced in <unk> <unk> plants a major crop in europe and canada using as a carrier a <unk> gene developed by robert goldberg at the university of california in los angeles 
 the <unk> gene is expressed just before the <unk> is about to develop and it <unk> the <unk> of every <unk> in the plant 
 mr. <unk> said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant 
 the researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering <unk> in order to get <unk> plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop 
 they attached a second gene for <unk> resistance to the <unk> gene 
 both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants which are then <unk> and allowed to mature and produce seed 
 the laws of <unk> <unk> that half of the plants <unk> from these <unk> seeds will be male <unk> and <unk> <unk> and half will be male <unk> and <unk> susceptible 
 the application of <unk> would kill off the <unk> plants leaving a large field of <unk> plants that can be <unk> to produce hybrid seed 
 mr. <unk> said the hybrid <unk> created with this genetic engineering yield N N to N N more output than the commercial <unk> used currently 
 this technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops he said and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the <unk> of each type of crop 
 he said the company is <unk> with the technique on <unk> and plans to include cotton and corn among other crops 
 he said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are <unk> the genetic approach will <unk> the need for mechanical <unk> of <unk> which costs u.s. seed producers about $ N million annually 
 in recent years demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies including monsanto co. shell oil co. and eli lilly & co 
 one technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical <unk> supposed to kill only a plant 's <unk> 
 but there have been problems with chemical <unk> damaging plants ' female reproductive <unk> and concern for the <unk> of such chemical <unk> to humans animals and beneficial <unk> 
 however paul <unk> monsanto 's director of plant sciences said the company 's chemical <unk> <unk> these problems and is <unk> on the female <unk> 
 <unk> genetics corp. <unk> calif. is developing a <unk> containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and <unk> with the genes that are responsible for producing <unk> 
 this gene called <unk> is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days 
 robert <unk> president of <unk> called plant genetic 's approach interesting and novel and <unk> rather than competitive 
 there is a large market out there <unk> for hybrid seeds he said 
 mr. robinson of delta & <unk> the seed producer in scott <unk> said plant genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male <unk> does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create <unk> in all crops 
 that 's because <unk> while easy in corn because the carrier is wind is more complex and involves <unk> as carriers in crops such as cotton 
 it 's one thing to say you can <unk> and another to then successfully <unk> the plant he said 
 nevertheless he said he is negotiating with plant genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton 
 a bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between nomura securities co. and industrial bank of japan two of the world 's most powerful financial companies 
 the clash is a sign of a new <unk> and <unk> in japan 's <unk> financial circles 
 not only are japan 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work increasingly they 're <unk> off against one another in unprecedented public fashion 
 already the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets even governments 
 what triggered the latest clash was a <unk> over the timing of a new zealand government bond issue 
 nomura was attempting to <unk> the N <unk> $ N million borrowing in japan at a time when many japanese banks led by industrial bank of japan were <unk> the wellington government to help them recover loans made to a <unk> investment bank that had been owned by new zealand 's <unk> pension fund 
 unwilling to put up new money for new zealand until those debts are repaid most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing forcing an embarrassed nomura to postpone it this week 
 the dispute shows clearly the global power of japan 's financial <unk> 
 aside from nomura 's injured pride the biggest victim so far has been the new zealand government 
 barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues wellington 's debt management office had been casting abroad to raise the N billion new zealand dollars us$ N billion to <unk> N billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next june N 
 with japan 's <unk> banks aligned against it though raising money may be difficult 
 not only can they block wellington from raising money in japan bankers here say but as the largest underwriters in the <unk> market they might be able to scuttle borrowings there too 
 new zealand 's finance minister david <unk> <unk> out at such suggestions 
 he told reporters in wellington tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to <unk> new zealand ltd. an investment bank <unk> by the national <unk> fund and would n't bail it out 
 it may very well be what the japanese banks want he told radio new zealand 
 i think it would be irresponsible and i am not about to be <unk> by japanese banks or any other international interests 
 no less significant than the japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries 
 anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate and protect the two industries from each other 
 both sides are <unk> <unk> their turf and relations have been at a <unk> for months 
 the banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business 
 meanwhile the securities companies most of them smaller than the banks are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks 
 nomura the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field and industrial bank of japan japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad <unk> the opposing sides 
 and their <unk> of each other run deep 
 in the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses 
 nomura started a credit-card venture with american express co. that allowed <unk> to use their nomura securities accounts like a bank account attracting the <unk> of banks 
 and industrial bank of japan started up a london securities subsidiary that sells japanese stocks to <unk> institutions overseas a move that <unk> the anger of the stock brokerage firms 
 the new zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face

 in a surprise move the british government cleared the way for a bidding war for jaguar plc by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker 
 trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley told the house of commons yesterday that he will <unk> the government 's so-called golden share in the company as long as jaguar shareholders agree 
 the golden share restricts any individual holding to N N and expires at the end of N 
 it was in jaguar 's best interests for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible mr. ridley said 
 mr. ridley 's decision fires the starting <unk> for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker 
 both general motors corp. and ford motor co. have been trying to <unk> N N stakes in jaguar 
 ford which already has an unwelcome N N holding is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early 
 gm has been negotiating a friendly transaction with jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under N N 
 but the government 's action which caught jaguar management <unk> may scuttle the gm minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of jaguar 
 i ca n't believe they gm will let ford have a free run said stephen reitman a european auto industry analyst at <unk> & drew 
 i am sure they will be going for a full bid 
 many investors certainly believe a bidding war is imminent 
 jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after mr. ridley 's announcement following their temporary suspension on london 's stock exchange 
 in late trading the shares were up a <unk> N pence $ N a N N gain to a record N pence on very heavy volume of N million shares 
 in the u.s. over-the-counter market jaguar shares trading as american depositary receipts closed at $ N up $ N 
 analysts expect ford will make the first move perhaps today with an initial offer of about N pence $ N a share 
 such a proposal values jaguar at more than # N billion $ N billion 
 speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks 
 the share price was <unk> at about N pence before ford 's sept. N announcement of its interest in a minority stake 
 ford is in the driving seat at the moment observed bob barber an auto analyst at brokers james capel & co 
 an aggressive ford bid for jaguar would put pressure on gm to make a better offer as the british company 's white knight 
 such a <unk> could end jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and <unk> 
 but it is n't clear how long gm would be willing to fight ford for jaguar 
 because of their longstanding <unk> gm just wants to make sure ford pays a huge <unk> for jaguar said john lawson an auto analyst at london 's nomura research institute 
 people close to the <unk> talks agreed that ford now may be able to shut out general motors 
 it 's either going to be a <unk> or there only may be one player in town one person said 
 another person close to the talks said it is very hard to justify paying a silly price for jaguar if an <unk> bidding war were to start now 
 in a statement jaguar 's board said they were not <unk> about the ridley decision in advance and were surprised at the action taken 
 the statement emphasized that holders representing N N of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions 
 jaguar officials in the u.s. noted that ford as jaguar 's largest shareholder now has the power to call for such a meeting 
 u.s. auto analysts also noted that ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid 
 jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened analysts add because fewer than N N of its shares are owned by employees and management 
 ford officials in the u.s. declined to comment on the british government 's action or on any plans to call a special jaguar shareholders meeting 
 but gm officials said they too were surprised by the move which left them to consider all our options and explore matters further 
 although gm has u.s. approval to buy up to N N of jaguar 's stock it has n't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns 
 in a prepared statement gm suggested its plans for jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial <unk> investors might reap from a hostile ford bid 
 our intensive discussions with jaguar at their invitation gm said have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great british car company to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders 
 jaguar was shocked by mr. ridley 's decision because management had believed the government would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first 
 indeed the government is taking a calculated risk 
 mr. ridley 's announcement set off a <unk> of protests from members of the opposition labor party who accused the thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company 
 the british government retained the single golden share after selling its stake in jaguar in 
 the conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election expected in late N 
 it 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with observed daniel jones professor of motor industry management at the university of <unk> in <unk> 
 the government already <unk> by high interest rates and a slowing economy has been badly hurt by last week 's <unk> in mrs. thatcher 's cabinet 
 at the same time the government did n't want to appear to favor gm by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by ford 
 mr. ridley hinted at this motive in <unk> questions from members of parliament after his announcement 
 he said he was giving up the golden share to clear the way so the playing field is level between all <unk>

 this week was <unk> for the cd market said <unk> mehl chairman of banxquote 
 the major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month treasury bill rates in the past two weeks

 the cd trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the treasury bill auction monday 
 the average six-month bill was sold with a yield of N N up from N N 
 the average three-month issue rose to N N from N N 
 typically banks offer cd yields higher than those on treasury bills which are considered the <unk> short-term investments banks need a competitive edge to sell their products

 but as the french <unk> a <unk> state of <unk> when it comes to athletics try finding a <unk> machine in paris my fellow <unk> were having none of it 
 the <unk> at my table simply <unk> more <unk> and <unk> at the suggestion of <unk> a perfectly good saturday morning to go <unk> or even <unk> ballooning to you the brothers <unk> french of course were the world 's first <unk> <unk> 
 back in the u.s.a. this kind of <unk> <unk> activity wins <unk> <unk> responses 
 as in you went ballooning 
 in france 
 americans it seems have followed malcolm <unk> 's <unk> lead and taken to ballooning in a <unk> way 
 during the past N years the number of <unk> those who have passed a federal aviation authority <unk> test have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand with some estimates running as high as N 
 some N balloon shows are held annually in the u.s. including the world 's largest <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> international balloon <unk> that attracts some N enthusiasts and more than N <unk> some of which are <unk> <unk> to resemble <unk> <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> balloon was denied official entry status this year 
 but in <unk> a gray <unk> river town adjacent to france 's <unk> mountain region none of these <unk> <unk> for things <unk> was evident 
 ballooning at the de <unk> hour of N a.m. held all the attraction for most people of <unk> <unk> work 
 feeling the <unk> of a culture <unk> i promptly signed up 
 the first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic <unk> or even a measure of <unk> 
 so long as you do n't look down 
 they will also tell you that even if you hate heights you can still balloon 
 i still say do n't look down 
 at least not when you are <unk> 
 what they wo n't tell you is not to go <unk> in anything you do n't want to get <unk> 
 i 'm not referring to the traditional champagne <unk> during the <unk> <unk> 
 i 'm talking about landing in a <unk> 
 in a <unk> <unk> basket 
 with a pilot who speaks no english 
 to <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> are referred to as <unk> began at <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and ended at noon in a <unk> field 
 balloon flights almost always occur at <unk> or <unk> when the <unk> are <unk> 
 in between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the <unk> <unk> and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers 
 when it was n't my turn in the balloon i followed its progress from the chase car listening to the driver <unk> into a <unk> 
 after long <unk> of this <unk> ground activity came N or so lovely minutes of <unk> above the <unk> watching the silver <unk> rise off the river and the french <unk> <unk> about the fields 
 it 's hard not to feel that god 's in his <unk> with this kind of <unk> view of the world even if your <unk> in silly <unk> <unk> kept pointing out how <unk> it all was 
 eventually little french farmers and their little french <unk> came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and <unk> at us 
 no wonder 
 we were coming down straight into their <unk> 
 see the other rule of <unk> about ballooning is that you ca n't steer 
 and neither can your pilot 
 you can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane <unk> which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air <unk> 
 which makes the chase car necessary 
 most <unk> seldom go higher than N feet and most average a <unk> N miles an hour 
 when the balloon is <unk> along at a steady <unk> there is little sense of motion 
 only when one is <unk> or in our case <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> does one feel well <unk> in a <unk> basket 
 what 's he doing <unk> my companion who was the only other <unk> member of the convention and whose <unk> were white 
 attention <unk> our pilot as our basket plunged into the <unk> 
 you bet attention i <unk> back leaping <unk> the propane tanks i 'm wearing <unk> <unk> 
 our pilot simply <unk> fired up the <unk> and with another blast of <unk> lifted us oh a good <unk> above the water level 
 we <unk> along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again 
 eventually we came to rest in a <unk> patch of field where we had the <unk> pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the <unk> while the french half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in 
 i looked at my watch 
 barely <unk> <unk> 
 back in the chase car we drove around some more got stuck in a <unk> <unk> the aid of a local farmer to get out the <unk> <unk> and pull us out of the <unk> 
 we finally <unk> with our balloon which had come to rest on a <unk> road amid a <unk> of <unk> who watched us <unk> our craft another <unk> of <unk> activity that included the precision routine of <unk> the balloon to the ground <unk> all the air out of it rolling it up and <unk> it and the basket into the <unk> 
 it was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the <unk> <unk> hole 
 this meant returning to the golf course where we watched a few french <unk> <unk> the first <unk> while we sat under <unk> <unk> me nursing an <unk> and my <unk> 
 a whole morning of ballooning and i had been off the ground barely N minutes 
 still i figured the event 's <unk> back in the u.s.a. was near <unk> 
 as for the ride back to camp our pilot and all the other <unk> passengers <unk> into the chase car 
 my american companion and i were left to ride <unk> in the <unk> basket

 treasury undersecretary david mulford defended the treasury 's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar saying it helped minimize damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market oct. N 
 <unk> before a house subcommittee mr. mulford said that if the treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in september and early october to reduce the dollar 's value the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have <unk> financial markets 
 mr. mulford responding to critics of intervention also said intervention is highly visible is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than was recognized some time ago 
 differences between the treasury and the federal reserve on the <unk> of intervention to help restrain the dollar <unk> at the hearing 
 fed vice chairman manuel johnson who had <unk> from the treasury 's policy told lawmakers i became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market 
 intervention he added is useful only to smooth <unk> markets not to fundamentally influence the dollar 's value 
 rep. john <unk> d. n.y said mr. johnson refused to testify jointly with mr. mulford and instead asked to appear after the treasury official had completed his testimony 
 a fed spokesman denied mr. <unk> 's statement 
 mr. mulford said reports of tension between the treasury and fed have been <unk> insisting that they involved <unk> 
 mr. johnson also said that in the scheme of things these things are minor 
 on other matters mr. mulford said west germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter 
 the solution is stronger domestic growth in germany he said 
 but because the growth of the german economy has been stronger than expected mr. mulford said it 's difficult for the u.s. to argue that germany ought to adopt more <unk> monetary and fiscal policies 
 germany 's trade surplus is largely with other european countries rather than with the u.s. mr. mulford acknowledged 
 but nonetheless u.s. companies might be more successful in european markets if not for the german export push he said

 some u.s. allies are complaining that president bush is pushing <unk> talks too quickly creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of western europe for years 
 concerns about the pace of the vienna talks which are aimed at the destruction of some N weapons as well as major reductions and <unk> of troops in central europe also are being registered at the pentagon 
 mr. bush has called for an agreement by next september at the latest 
 but some american defense officials believe the north atlantic treaty organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered 
 for one thing pentagon officials who asked not to be identified worry that the u.s. will have a much tougher time <unk> europeans to keep some <unk> nuclear weapons on their soil once soviet <unk> forces are <unk> out 
 at the same time they contend that a reduction of nato forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional soviet attack unless the west retains a <unk> force of nuclear weapons in europe 
 allies concerned about the deadline include the british french and smaller nato allies some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted 
 so far no ally has complained openly preserving the impression that nato is in line with the bush position that a quick agreement bringing soviet conventional forces down to parity with nato is the west 's top bargaining priority 
 but even though nato negotiators have only N months left under the bush timetable they are still <unk> over such seemingly fundamental questions as what is a tank 
 five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined 
 tanks currently are defined as <unk> vehicles weighing N tons or more that carry large guns 
 the soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks which are as light as N tons 
 <unk> a. <unk> the chief soviet negotiator in the <unk> talks argued that this would mean the soviets would have to destroy some N tanks while the u.s. would lose none because it has no light tanks in europe 
 but the issue is <unk> than it seems 
 france britain and italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks 
 and some u.s. army analysts worry that the proposed soviet <unk> is aimed at blocking the u.s. from developing lighter more <unk> high-technology tanks 
 <unk> combat aircraft is even tougher 
 the soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks then argued for <unk> some N russian planes because they are solely defensive 
 nato has n't <unk> from its insistence that any <unk> plane has offensive capability 
 the dispute over that issue according to one u.s. official is a potential treaty <unk> and only president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev may be able to resolve it 
 accounting problems raise more <unk> issues 
 greece and turkey for example are suspected of <unk> their <unk> in hopes that they can emerge from the <unk> treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other 
 other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own <unk> 
 it 's just going to be sloppy both on our side and theirs the warsaw pact 's says one nato analyst 
 so far neither the bush administration nor arms-control experts in congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to <unk> out than president bush has allowed 
 they argue that the bigger danger would be that the west would delay action so long that the soviets might back away from the current <unk> attitude 
 so what if you miss N tanks somewhere asks rep. norman <unk> d. wash. a member of the house group that visited the talks in vienna 
 the bottom line is that if we can get that warsaw pact <unk> brought down to parity we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible 
 i worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate

 coca-cola co. aiming to boost soft-drink volume in singapore said it is discussing a joint venture with fraser & <unk> ltd. its bottling franchisee in that country 
 the venture would be the latest in coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment 
 so far this year it has put nearly $ N million into bottling operations in australia new zealand and france 
 the move also reflects coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in pacific basin countries 
 aside from europe the pacific division is where coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come 
 that 's because when coke looks to the pacific area it sees an economic and <unk> gold mine 
 in countries such as taiwan south korea and singapore economies are growing resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks 
 and unlike europe and the u.s. where <unk> are aging the pacific basin countries have growing <unk> of <unk> the heaviest consumers of coca-cola and other <unk> 
 a coca-cola spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured or how much the company would invest in the transaction 
 in the past however coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures 
 by acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the u.s. and overseas coke has been able to improve <unk> ' efficiency and production and in some cases marketing 
 coke has <unk> to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country 
 that does n't appear to be the case in singapore a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate a key indicator of coke 's success in a market 
 in singapore <unk> consumption is about one-third that of the u.s. 
 and combining fraser & <unk> 's own soft drinks with coca-cola 's gives the singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there coke said 
 fraser & <unk> which also has interests in packaging beer and dairy products holds the coke licenses for malaysia and <unk> where <unk> consumption is n't as high as in singapore 
 coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the <unk> potential in those markets 
 a coke spokesman said he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks 
 coke said the joint-venture arrangement which needs approval from both companies ' boards should be completed early next year

 congressional democrats and the bush administration agreed on a compromise minimum-wage bill opening the way for the first <unk> boost in more than nine years 
 the agreement ended a long <unk> between the congressional leaders and the white house over the wage issue 
 president bush in june vetoed a measure passed by congress and said he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue 
 the compromise was a somewhat <unk> version of what the white house had said it would accept 
 under the agreement with the house and senate leaders the minimum wage would rise from the current $ N an hour to $ N an hour by april N 
 employers could also pay a <unk> training wage for N days to new workers who are up to N years old and then for another N days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers 
 white house officials were <unk> that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage which mr. bush has fought for throughout the year 
 for the first time in history we have a training wage that will be part of the nation 's labor laws said roger porter assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy 
 white house aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by mr. bush 
 the bill vetoed by the president in june which the house failed to override would have lifted the minimum wage to $ N an hour by late N with a training wage for up to two months generally for a worker 's first job 
 mr. bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ N an hour by the end of N coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer 
 under the compromise the $ N level would be reached nine months earlier while the training <unk> would be shorter unless it is tied to a training plan 
 democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their jobs 
 democrats had been negotiating with some republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately 
 with congressional elections next year gop leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for <unk> workers at a time when congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit <unk> taxpayers 
 republicans have been <unk> the white house to compromise on the wage issue 
 in the senate edward kennedy d. mass. chairman of the labor committee and pete <unk> r. <unk> ranking minority member of the budget committee have been working on a compromise and their <unk> showed that the senate appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another bush veto a democratic staff official said 
 the house is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise as a substitute to a new democratic bill itself <unk> down from last spring 's version 
 the senate will probably vote not long afterward 
 some democrats thought they might have <unk> too much 
 rep. austin murphy d. pa. chairman of the house labor standards subcommittee said they might have done better if we 'd held their feet to the fire 
 mr. kennedy suggested democrats yielded a great deal on the size of the increase but he cited concessions from the white house on the training wage which he said make it less harsh 
 with only <unk> to <unk> eligible N N of workers getting less than $ N an hour who are adults wo n't be subject to the training wage he said 
 the <unk> which previously opposed the administration 's <unk> idea said the compromise has adequate <unk> so the youth are not <unk> and older workers are not <unk>

 moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $ N billion of houston lighting & power co. 's securities because of the company 's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation 
 houston lighting is a unit of houston industries inc. a utility holding company in houston

 armstrong world industries inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to shaw industries inc 
 the price was n't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $ N million 
 armstrong which has faced a takeover threat from the <unk> family of canada since july said that <unk> of the carpet business would improve total financial performance 
 the move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses which include ceramic <unk> floor <unk> and furniture 
 moreover such a sale could help armstrong <unk> its investors and deter the <unk> who own a N N stake in the lancaster pa. company 
 analysts expect armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition 
 the carpet division had N sales of $ N million or almost N N of armstrong 's $ N billion total revenue 
 the company has been manufacturing carpet since N 
 recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make <unk> products with higher quality <unk> 
 for the past year or two the carpet division 's operating profit margins have <unk> around N N high by industry standards but disappointing compared with the N N to N N margins for two of armstrong 's chief businesses <unk> and building products 
 analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to armstrong and shaw the market leader in the u.s. carpet industry with an estimated N N to N N share 
 shaw based in <unk> ga. has annual sales of about $ N billion and has economies of scale and lower <unk> costs that are expected to boost the profitability of armstrong 's brands sold under the armstrong and <unk> names 
 yesterday in composite trading on the new york stock exchange shaw 's shares closed ex-dividend at $ N up $ N 
 armstrong 's shares also listed on the big board closed at $ N up N cents 
 yesterday armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months <unk> by the stock <unk> of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year 
 for the quarter earnings were $ N million or N cents a share including a one-time gain of $ N million 
 in the year-ago quarter earnings were $ N million or N cents a share 
 yesterday armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small applied color systems unit to a subsidiary of the swiss company <unk> <unk> ltd

 armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late november and the carpet sale in december with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or first-quarter results 
 the government 's primary <unk> gauge rose a slight N N in september but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the u.s. economy is slowing 
 the small increase in the index of leading indicators which had climbed N N in august but was unchanged in july does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed <unk> 
 however it does n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon 
 i do n't think it provides much new information on the economy said richard <unk> economist at dean witter reynolds inc 
 so far this year the index of leading indicators has risen in four months fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month 
 in another report yesterday the commerce department said sales of new single-family houses plunged N N in september to an annual rate of N from N in august 
 the declines were particularly <unk> in the northeast and in the south where hurricane hugo was a factor 
 although september 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market 
 the september drop was the largest since a N N drop in january N but monthly changes in this measure are even less <unk> than those in other economic indicators 
 because the figures are based on a small sample the department said it is N N confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between N N and N N during the month 
 the department also said it takes four months to establish a trend 
 so far this year N newly built homes have been sold down N N from the like months of N 
 the index of leading indicators got a major boost in september from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the university of michigan 
 this measure had dropped sharply in august 
 the commerce department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index the influence of this component has been reduced 
 of the N components to the index only three others rose in september the money supply the length of the average work week and stock prices 
 several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in september 
 these include new orders for manufactured consumer goods lead times on vendor deliveries orders for new plant and equipment and backlogs of orders for durable goods 
 meanwhile the national association of manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of N executives on its board found that N N do n't expect a recession to occur until N or later 
 the remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in 
 although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates N N of the executives said they would prefer that the fed keep <unk> as its top priority even if that means higher rates 
 the other N N said the fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down 
 all the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns 
 here are the net contributions of the components of the commerce department 's index of leading indicators 
 after various adjustments they produced a N N rise in the index for august and a N N rise for september 
 september and the change from august are from N in the previous month 
 boston edison co. said it will take a previously reported $ N million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter 
 the charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the massachusetts department of public utilities

 in its order the state regulatory agency said the company must be held <unk> for the mistakes made in the management of the plant 's operation 
 <unk> had been closed for N months

 an <unk> novelist writing a <unk> about <unk> <unk> might <unk> a clifford stoll but it 's unlikely 
 it 's also unnecessary 
 <unk> <unk> clifford stoll is a real person or as he might <unk> put it a <unk> person 
 he is N an <unk> with impressive credentials and something of a <unk> at making computers do his bidding 
 he once described himself as a berkeley <unk> and played the role well <unk> <unk> jeans a <unk> of long hair and rejection of all things conventional including for a time at least formal marriage to his <unk> <unk> matthews 
 he also is an entertaining writer combining <unk> and <unk> with <unk> detail and <unk> <unk> of how computers work 
 in the <unk> 's egg <unk> N pages $ N he <unk> a remarkable tale of his efforts over N months to catch a computer spy 
 the result last spring was the arrest by west german authorities of five young west germans accused of stealing information from computers in the u.s. and europe and selling it to the soviet kgb 
 one of them <unk> <unk> hess of <unk> allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than N <unk> computers in the u.s. searching for secrets 
 he probably did n't <unk> any <unk> files but the kgb in east berlin was willing to pay two of his associates peter carl and <unk> <unk> $ N for some of the material hess collected 
 they promised yet more for really good stuff 
 mr. stoll draws his title from the <unk> 's habit of laying eggs in the <unk> of other birds making them <unk> parents 
 the computer spy had discovered that a popular <unk> mail program called <unk> could do <unk> with the widely used unix operating system created by at&t 
 using <unk> the spy could substitute a <unk> <unk> program for the one that routinely <unk> up the unix system every five minutes 
 once his <unk> 's egg was laid he could enter unix and become a <unk> with access to everything 
 mr. stoll was <unk> the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> of the lawrence berkeley laboratory in N when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab 's computers 
 he discovered a <unk> <unk> in the charges made to various departments for computer time and <unk> it to a user named hunter who had no valid billing address 
 mr. stoll suspected the <unk> was one of those <unk> students who has fun breaking into computers 
 but after much tracking it became evident to mr. stoll through various clues that the hacker was not on the berkeley campus or even in california 
 finding him became an <unk> for mr. stoll 
 he made a midnight <unk> of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab 's computers 
 after <unk> that the hacker had taken over the <unk> account of a legitimate user named joe <unk> he <unk> up an alarm system including a portable <unk> to alert him when <unk> came on the line 
 some nights he <unk> under his desk 
 his boss complained about <unk> of other chores 
 the hacker was <unk> over the berkeley files but also using berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies 
 the white <unk> missile range and cia contractor <unk> inc. were among the targets 
 when the hacker moved mr. stoll moved too calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid <unk> <unk> 
 sometimes if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file he would drag his <unk> across the terminal to create <unk> or slow the system down to <unk> his <unk> 
 the fbi initially showed little interest and he had the impression other federal security agencies were <unk> up in legal red tape 
 the cia told him it does not do domestic <unk> 
 one <unk> a lot from this book or seems to about <unk> federal bureaucracy 
 seems to because it 's possible that the cia and the national security agency were more interested than they let on to mr. stoll 
 finally he got help 
 <unk> is a major network linking computers 
 one of its international specialists steve white took a quick interest in mr. stoll 's hunt ultimately <unk> the hacker to west germany 
 the west germans then took over and finally found <unk> hess 
 eventually mr. stoll was invited to both the cia and <unk> to brief <unk> officers on computer theft 
 he <unk> the humor of his <unk> appearance among these <unk> <unk> 
 back in berkeley he was <unk> <unk> by a <unk> lady friend for <unk> with such people 
 he became angry in return 
 he had developed a <unk> for the hacker and a <unk> appreciation of the federal <unk> who make national security their business

 mips computer systems inc. today will unveil a new <unk> computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as sun microsystems inc. and digital equipment corp 
 the closely held sunnyvale calif. company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to control data corp. which will sell mips machines under its own label 
 the new mips machine called the <unk> will cost $ N for a basic system 
 the computer processes N million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip unlike many rival machines using several processors 
 the machine employs reduced <unk> computing or risc technology 
 at that price an analyst familiar with the machine said the computer offers up to N times the performance of similar machines 
 in the price range it 's a <unk> <unk> product said <unk> <unk> an analyst at the <unk> firm <unk> 
 the machine is part of an effort by mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers not just of <unk> technology 
 mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional risc applications such as engineering mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications 
 this clearly demonstrates that mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company said mips vice president john <unk> 
 the control data deal is a <unk> for mips because it gives the the <unk> company one more ally as it <unk> more established electronic concerns such as sun hewlett-packard co. motorola inc. and intel corp. for the emerging market for risc machines 
 risc technology speeds up a computer by <unk> the internal software 
 for mips which expects revenue of $ N million this year <unk> allies such as control data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's risc architecture 
 the thing it says about mips is that they 're on a roll right now said ms. <unk> at <unk> 
 they 're getting some major wins she added 
 last month for example mips agreed to supply its computers to <unk> computer ag of west germany and france 's <unk> bull 
 sony corp. tandem computers inc. and digital equipment have agreed to sell mips computers and companies such as japan 's nec corp. and west germany 's siemens a.g. have agreed to make mips chips under license 
 today 's agreement gives control data a machine to compete against digital and other <unk> computer makers said john <unk> a <unk> analyst at <unk> group inc. of boston 
 the machine is essentially a mainframe computer he said 
 suddenly <unk> control data has a competitive product to fight back against the <unk> a machine digital announced last month he added 
 control data based in minneapolis minn. expects its sales of mips systems including the new <unk> to amount to more than $ N million by the end of N mips said 
 <unk> bull and others will also sell versions of the machine said mips president robert miller 
 mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of N he said 
 the machine uses a single <unk> which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors 
 the computer can process N million calculations called <unk> operations every second 
 the machine can run software written for other mips computers the company said 
 another fight is brewing between congress and the bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit 
 in a hearing before the house ways and means committee the general accounting office and the congressional budget office which both are arms of congress advised the new s&l bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget 
 officials of the resolution trust corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout 
 instead the <unk> and the congressional budget office said the rtc should consider using treasury debt which is less expensive and subject to oversight by congress 
 the spending could be <unk> from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the gramm-rudman budget law 
 the rtc has projected that it will require between $ N billion to $ N billion in temporary working capital 
 the borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold 
 the new s&l law allows the rtc to issue notes for as much as N N of the value of the assets it holds 
 but higher interest rates paid on <unk> debt could add billions to the bailout costs and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny ways and means members argued 
 to allow this massive level of <unk> federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible said rep. <unk> stark d. calif. who has introduced a bill to limit the rtc 's authority to issue debt 
 the rtc will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years 
 the new s&l bailout law allows $ N billion to be spent to sell or merge sick s&ls and their assets but that is a net cost 
 in the meantime the agency must raise cash to maintain assets such as real estate until they can be sold 
 then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets 
 david mullins assistant secretary of the treasury said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions 
 he said it has n't yet been determined how the rtc will raise the cash but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget because it would <unk> the budget process by requiring either <unk> from gramm-rudman or big increases in the budget deficit 
 but the worst possibility would be raising no working capital he said 
 if working capital financing is not provided he said the rtc may have to slow s&l sales or dump acquired assets through fire sales 
 <unk> eastern corp. said it applied on behalf of two of its subsidiaries to the federal energy regulatory commission for permission to build a <unk> $ N million pipeline system from <unk> county okla. to independence miss

 under the agreement healthcare a manager of health-care facilities said it would pay healthvest $ N million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ N million in funds that healthvest advanced for construction work on facilities 
 in return healthvest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and <unk> against healthcare during the <unk> period 
 after the payment healthcare still will be $ N million in <unk> on rent and mortgage payments to healthvest a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by healthcare 
 healthcare has given healthvest a N N note for that overdue amount to be repaid over three years 
 in addition healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ N million to $ N million to healthvest during the standstill period to be paid when healthcare successfully <unk> asset sales 
 because healthcare actually owes healthvest $ N million in rent and mortgage payments each month the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note

 but the reserve fund america 's first money fund was not named nor were the <unk> of the money-fund concept harry brown and myself 
 we <unk> telephone redemptions daily dividends total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ N <unk> pricing all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some <unk> on the part of the sec 
 president 
 the reserve fund 
 the <unk> moment in the career of joseph f. o'kicki came as N local and state <unk> packed into his elegant <unk> courtroom here last year for his <unk> in as president judge of cambria county 
 baskets of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> his bench 
 the local american <unk> color guard led the way 
 as the judge marched down the center <unk> in his flowing black <unk> he was <unk> by a <unk> fanfare 
 to many it was a <unk> more <unk> a king than a rural judge <unk> in the isolated foothills of the southern <unk> <unk> 
 but then judge o'kicki often behaved like a man who would be king and some say an arrogant and <unk> one 
 while his case may be extreme it reflects the <unk> of many small communities to <unk> judges 
 last march nine months after the judge 's <unk> the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than N years of official <unk> in cambria county a depressed steel and mining community in western pennsylvania 
 the allegations ranging from theft and bribery to <unk> and <unk> <unk> a <unk> picture 
 according to testimony in a public <unk> <unk> report handed up to the state attorney general judge o'kicki <unk> cash from lawyers <unk> favorable loans from banks and <unk> local businesses for more than a decade 
 prosecutors in an indictment based on the grand jury 's report maintain that at various times since N he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer <unk> <unk> hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest set up a <unk> corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend now his second wife and maintained N accounts in six banks in cambria county 
 in testimony recorded in the grand jury report court employees said the judge now N years old <unk> his secretaries made imperial demands on his staff and <unk> anyone who crossed him 
 <unk> claimed they were required to <unk> him to and from work <unk> his lawn <unk> his wood fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 one former <unk> charged that the judge <unk> him by <unk> on a promise of a better paying job after <unk> a $ N bribe 
 some of the allegations are simply bizarre 
 two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge 's chambers on separate occasions to take <unk> only to find the judge in his <unk> underwear 
 one secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all 
 the judge suspended from his bench pending his trial which began this week <unk> denies all the allegations against him calling them <unk> and <unk> political <unk> 
 he blames the indictment on local political <unk> <unk> with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's <unk> and a <unk> by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them 
 i do n't know whose <unk> i 've stepped on says the judge 
 i 'll find out eventually who pushed the state police <unk> into action 
 even if only some of the allegations stand up however they provide ample testimony to the <unk> power of judges in rural communities 
 that power can sometimes be abused particularly since <unk> in smaller <unk> operate without many of the restraints that serve as <unk> measures in urban areas 
 lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year 
 fear of <unk> that judge is pervasive says maurice <unk> founder and director of the rural justice center in <unk> <unk> a public interest group that <unk> rural justice issues 
 as a result says mr. <unk> lawyers think twice before appealing a judge 's ruling are reluctant to mount or even support challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might <unk> a judge 's integrity 
 judge o'kicki a stern and <unk> man has been a <unk> in the local legal community for more than two decades 
 the son of an <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> he was raised in a small borough outside <unk> the cambria county seat and put himself through the university of pittsburgh law school 
 he <unk> near the top of his class serving on the school law review with richard thornburgh who went on to become governor of pennsylvania and now u.s. attorney general 
 it was also in law school that mr. o'kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters 
 he <unk> his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk 
 last year pennsylvania supreme court justice john p. <unk> called mr. o'kicki one of the <unk> judges not only in pennsylvania but in the united states 
 clearly the judge has had his share of <unk> 
 after practicing law locally he was elected to his first 10-year term as judge in N in N he was effectively <unk> 
 six years ago judge o'kicki was voted president of the pennsylvania conference of state trial judges by the state 's N judges 
 he has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court <unk> in pennsylvania 
 and when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in N the pennsylvania bar association rated him one of the best available after <unk> local lawyers 
 he probably was the <unk> guy who ever sat on our bench says a former president of cambria county 's <unk> bar association who like most lawyers in cambria county refuses to talk about the judge publicly 
 he 's sharp as a <unk> 
 he could grasp an issue with the <unk> of an eye 
 for more than a decade virtually no one complained about judge o'kicki 
 what about those institutions that are supposed to be the <unk> of society the banks and the bar association wrote a columnist for the <unk> a newspaper in nearby <unk> shortly after the scandal became public 
 if only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago the judicial process would n't be under the <unk> it is today 
 officials with the pennsylvania judicial inquiry and review board the arm of the state that <unk> judicial misconduct counter that they had no <unk> of anything <unk> in <unk> 
 nobody told us nobody called us says an official close to the case who asked not to be named 
 nobody had the <unk> to complain 
 certainly not the lawyers 
 <unk> attorney richard j. green jr. <unk> out $ N in loans to the judge over five years he said in testimony to the grand jury 
 the judge never made a <unk> of <unk> the money said mr. green 
 eventually mr. green testified he began <unk> out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited 
 when mr. green won a $ N verdict in a land <unk> case against the state in june N he says judge o'kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $ N 
 mr. green thought little of it he told the grand jury until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a <unk> 
 do n't you think i ought to get a commission or part of your fee in this case mr. green said the judge asked him 
 <unk> mr. green never paid the money he testified 
 but he did n't complain to the state 's judicial inquiry and review board either saying later that he feared <unk> 
 mr. o'kicki said he will respond to mr. green 's <unk> at his trial 
 like most of cambria county 's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge mr. green declined to be interviewed for this article 
 and no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed 
 i do n't have anything much to say and i think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here says local attorney edward f. <unk> 
 says another lawyer the practice of law is a matter of <unk> one 's <unk> when you live in a small community 
 one had best not dance on top of a <unk> until the lid is <unk> tightly shut 
 the judge was considered <unk> <unk> and ambitious those who practiced before him say 
 he <unk> tea sweetened with <unk> from his <unk> leather chair at his bench while <unk> notes ordering <unk> to stop <unk> or to take off their hats in his courtroom 
 four years ago he jailed all nine members of the cambria county school board for several hours after they <unk> his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers ' strike 
 visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the years months weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the <unk> president judge giving judge o'kicki the seniority required to take over as the county 's top court administrator 
 the judge they say was fiercely proud of his <unk> and <unk> 
 my name is judge judge o'kicki told a car salesman in <unk> when he bought a new red <unk> <unk> in october N according to the <unk> report 
 the dealership <unk> recorded the sale under the name judge o'kicki 
 yet despite the judge 's imperial bearing no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing says john <unk> president of cambria county 's <unk> bar association 
 the <unk> of a judge his <unk> the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint says mr. <unk> 
 until this came up and hit the press there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong 
 state investigators dispute that view now particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in cambria county 
 the judge came under scrutiny in late N after the state attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in cambria county 
 the inquiry soon focused on the judge 
 even his routine business transactions caused trouble according to the grand jury report 
 when the judge bought his new <unk> from james e. black <unk> in <unk> five years ago the dealership had certain <unk> about the judge 's reputation according to the <unk> report 
 the dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction <unk> by <unk> 's local lender laurel bank 
 then as an additional <unk> the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand proof that he had received the loan documents 
 but when the judge received his payment book he <unk> the deal 
 there was no loan there is no loan there never shall be a loan the judge wrote the bank on his judicial <unk> according to the report 
 later the judge went a step <unk> 
 after laurel bank tried to <unk> the car a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account 
 the judge wrote again 
 i find myself in an adversary relationship with laurel bank and i am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report 
 perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with laurel bank in the near future i may be inclined to reconsider your request 
 the judge now says it was unfortunate that he chose to write the letter but says there was certainly no intent to <unk> there 
 the bank <unk> 
 it <unk> the judge 's loan lowered its interest rate and accepted a <unk> that had n't originally been part of the deal a beat up N chevy <unk> the dealer had to repair before it could be <unk> 
 the incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank 
 two years later he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ N loan was absolutely onerous 
 paul l. kane laurel 's president at the time quickly responded 
 the bank he wrote back was immediately lowering the rate by N N as a <unk> to you 
 the judge says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe he would be far <unk> than he is 
 his <unk> <unk> and brick house outside of <unk> is up for sale to pay for his lawyers 
 the judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench 
 already he notes the N charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to N 
 most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement 
 the heart of the case official <unk> remains intact 
 if i lose i lose my position my career my pension my home and my investments says the judge 
 my god and i know i am correct and innocent

 the internal revenue service said it is willing to let the u.s. tax court decide how much oil man william herbert hunt will owe the government after his assets are liquidated 
 the surprise announcement came after the irs broke off negotiations with mr. hunt on a settlement of the one-time <unk> 's personal bankruptcy case 
 although the action <unk> one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case it also means that mr. hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the tax court rules against him in a N case heard earlier this year in washington <unk> 
 the irs has been seeking more than $ N million in back taxes from mr. hunt 
 separately a federal judge hearing mr. hunt 's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $ N million settlement between mr. hunt and minpeco s.a. another major creditor in the case 
 the <unk> minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $ N million against mr. hunt 
 in addition to turning down the compromise judge harold c. abramson said he would allow a claim of only $ N million 
 minpeco attorneys said they would appeal the decision to a federal district court 
 regarding mr. hunt 's taxes he and the irs have apparently agreed on a basic formula for <unk> his estate in which the irs would get N N of the proceeds from a <unk> trust and N N would go to other creditors

 japan has found another safe <unk> for its money u.s. home mortgages 
 an increasing number of big japanese investors are buying up u.s. home mortgages that have been <unk> and packaged for sale as <unk> instruments known as mortgage-backed securities 
 as much as N N of new u.s. mortgage securities issued by the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corp. or freddie mac now flow into japanese hands 
 that may not come as a surprise to americans who have watched the japanese <unk> up properties in the u.s. from golf courses to a stake in rockefeller center 
 but it marks a big change for the japanese who <unk> mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back 
 you ca n't say it 's a <unk> <unk> wave but we 're making some <unk> says fannie mae 's chairman david o. maxwell who visits tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities 
 interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago 
 the steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the u.s. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here 
 evidence of the growing japanese demand for mortgage securities <unk> 
 earlier this year blackstone group a new york investment bank had no trouble selling out a special $ N million <unk> trust it created for japanese investors 
 industrial bank of japan which claims to be the biggest japanese buyer of u.s. mortgage securities says it will more than double its purchases this year to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars 
 and a fannie mae <unk> this week promises to draw hundreds of prospective investors who can be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years 
 last year there were only several big investors who were interested says <unk> <unk> a vice president at the international arm of nomura securities co 
 this year some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot 
 ultimately he says strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities 
 at the moment nomura is the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of fannie mae instruments 
 but other japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the <unk> selling group 
 these securities are attractive to japanese investors for three reasons 
 first they are safe 
 while they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government as treasury bonds are it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary 
 u.s. treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term japanese investors 
 second they are liquid 
 the secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ N billion or nearly half of the $ N trillion in u.s. residential mortgages issued 
 third they offer high yields 
 at the moment some offer as much as N to N percentage points over treasury securities of similar maturities 
 but there is a risk which the japanese discovered when they first dipped their <unk> into the market nearly five years ago 
 since most mortgages can be prepaid or <unk> at any time issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity 
 that 's a <unk> for long-term investors since it forces them to reinvest their money usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried 
 two or three years ago the problem was that people did n't understand the prepayment risk says nomura 's mr. <unk> 
 so they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment 
 <unk> the trouble to japanese investors mortgage securities pay interest monthly since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments 
 but japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems 
 as a result japanese investors <unk> clear of the mortgage securities 
 but they did n't lose touch with the u.s. issuers 
 since N japanese investors have bought nearly N N of $ N billion in fannie mae corporate debt issued to foreigners money that fannie mae uses to buy mortgages from u.s. banks 
 and japanese investors took up nearly all of two $ N million real estate mortgage investment <unk> a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation that were offered to foreigners this year 
 in addition further packaging of mortgage-backed securities such as blackstone 's fund have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to 
 freddie mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments 
 as georgia-pacific 's bid for great northern nekoosa has shown <unk> takeovers are still alive despite <unk> reports of their demise 
 therefore the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the <unk> of corporations and the halls of <unk> 
 although poison pills come in different colors and <unk> they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur typically if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation 's stock 
 however these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation 's directors if they approve of a bidder 
 supporters of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation 's directors who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation 
 recent studies by <unk> & co. conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater <unk> appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years 
 critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by <unk> premium bids from ever being made to shareholders 
 these critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run but also over longer periods 
 institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill 
 does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record 
 does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values and does this strategy require <unk> over an extended period 
 will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy 
 if the answers to these questions are <unk> then institutional investors are likely to be <unk> <unk> toward a specific poison pill 
 however the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted they survive forever 
 although the current management team may be outstanding who will be the ceo in N years 
 although the five-year strategy may be excellent what will be the strategy in N years 
 the solution to this problem is a <unk> poison pill 
 the limit could range from three years to seven years depending on the <unk> of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan 
 at the end of this period the poison pill would be eliminated automatically unless a new poison pill were approved by the <unk> shareholders who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management team at that time 
 one rare example of a <unk> poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from texaco 
 pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner 
 another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by <unk> national intergroup inc. a diversified holding company 
 the state of wisconsin investment board which owned about N N of the company 's voting stock worked with management to devise a <unk> poison pill 
 this pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders 
 the attitude of the wisconsin investment board reflects a growing <unk> to <unk> poison pills on the part of institutional investors as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the council of institutional investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions 
 more widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team 's strategy 
 such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more <unk> dialogue between management and shareholders than the <unk> debate about poison pills 
 mr. <unk> is the general counsel and a managing director of fidelity investments in boston 
 michael blair former president and chief executive officer of enfield corp. failed to win election to the company 's board at a special shareholder meeting 
 mr. blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the ontario supreme court for <unk> dismissal against enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder canadian express ltd. and two executives of hees international bancorp inc. which controls canadian express 
 holders at the meeting elected a full slate of canadian express <unk> to enfield 's <unk> board

 buying N N of rockefeller group inc. is right up mitsubishi estate co. 's alley in one sense the huge japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative u.s. owner of tony urban property 
 but in another sense the $ N million purchase is <unk> <unk> industry analysts say 
 the usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns new york 's <unk> rockefeller center at a time when <unk> over japanese purchases of u.s. property are at an <unk> high 
 officials of rockefeller group and mitsubishi estate prefer to focus on the <unk> nearly <unk> the threat of a backlash from the u.s. public 
 we think there will be positive as well as negative reactions says raymond <unk> senior vice president and chief financial officer of rockefeller group 
 on balance we think it will be positive 
 but some japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being 
 in particular they <unk> the timing coming as it does on the heels of sony corp. 's controversial purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc 
 officially yes we encourage the free flow of direct investment says a foreign ministry official 
 but they did n't have to choose this particular moment 
 during the past year government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged japanese companies to <unk> from flashy real estate purchases in the 
 since the mid-1980s japan 's other major real estate purchases in the u.s. include dai-ichi <unk> america corp. 's $ N million purchase of an office building at N east <unk> st. in manhattan in N and mitsui <unk> inc. 's $ N million purchase of the exxon building part of rockefeller center in N 
 in los angeles arco plaza was sold to <unk> corp. for $ N million in N and <unk> life insurance co. paid $ N million for atlanta 's ibm tower last year 
 altogether annual japanese investment in u.s. commercial real estate grew from about $ N billion in N to about $ N billion in N 
 many japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties 
 critics say mitsubishi estate 's decision to buy into rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are <unk> by the pressure to act for the good of japan 
 those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to <unk> but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention says an official of the <unk> business council 
 but to mitsubishi estate the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides 
 first of all it is a friendly acquisition in which rockefeller sought out mitsubishi estate and asked it to buy a majority share 
 <unk> the two companies found a similarity in their business and development <unk> and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications 
 finally mitsubishi estate has no plans to interfere with rockefeller 's management beyond taking a place on the board 
 we 'll continue to work with them in keeping with the reputation of the company and we 'll rely very much on their leadership says mitsubishi estate president <unk> <unk> 
 rockefeller may well have found its match in mitsubishi estate a company of long history strong government ties and sound resources 
 in asset terms mitsubishi estate is the largest real estate firm in japan 
 the core of its holdings is N square <unk> of <unk> expensive property in the <unk> district the business and financial center of tokyo often <unk> called mitsubishi village 
 the mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some N years ago when it was a portion of <unk> residential land running from the <unk> of the imperial palace east toward the <unk> of tiny shops and <unk> <unk> that made up the merchants ' district 
 at the time japan had just opened its doors to the world after about N years of <unk> and needed a western-style business center 
 mitsubishi built the government 's dream development the story goes in exchange for the official decision to <unk> tokyo 's central railway station there 
 that was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the mitsubishi group the dubious <unk> of <unk> literally <unk> a title that has the <unk> <unk> of doing the government 's bidding but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties 
 mitsubishi estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's mitsubishi group 
 it 's known for its <unk> in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures in the year ended march N N N of its total revenue came from office building management 
 its earnings can rise N N to N N annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases says <unk> mcdonald an industry analyst at james capel pacific ltd 
 for the latest fiscal year the company 's net income jumped a robust N N to N billion yen $ N million 
 for mitsubishi estate the rockefeller purchase will <unk> it firmly into the overseas real estate business the one area where it has lagged notably behind japanese competitors such as mitsui which had purchased the exxon building 
 japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification says <unk> <unk> an industry analyst at goldman sachs japan corp 
 rockefeller is n't the first overseas purchase for mitsubishi estate it has already played a leading role in designing los angeles 's citicorp plaza 
 but the rockefeller investment is its largest 
 nonetheless it will barely make a <unk> in mitsubishi estate 's finances analysts say 
 mitsubishi estate has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase which are due in cash next april but the <unk> holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as N trillion yen to N trillion yen 
 moreover as a member of the mitsubishi group which is headed by one of japan 's largest banks it is sure to win a favorable loan 
 analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants 
 meanwhile at home mitsubishi has control of some major projects 
 it is the largest private-sector <unk> of the <unk> N project a <unk> development in the port city of <unk> about an hour outside tokyo 
 the project is one of a select group of public projects opened to u.s. firms under a <unk> construction trade agreement reached last year 
 the centerpiece of that complex the landmark tower will be japan 's <unk> building when it is completed in N 
 mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to <unk> <unk> into a business center of high-tech buildings a project <unk> for N years and six trillion yen 
 time warner inc. and sony corp. may be today 's public enemies but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their <unk> legal dispute over hollywood producers peter guber and jon peters 
 the warner bros. studio and sony signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday asking a los angeles superior court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on warner 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking mr. guber and mr. peters from taking the top posts at columbia pictures entertainment inc 
 in separate statements the two sides said they want to have further discussions 
 sony is acquiring columbia and guber-peters entertainment co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $ N billion 
 warner communications inc. which is being acquired by time warner has filed a $ N billion <unk> suit against sony and the two producers 
 warner has a five-year exclusive contract with mr. guber and mr. peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the warner bros. studio 
 the two sides in the legal battle have <unk> accusations of <unk> at each other for weeks and both warner and sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business 
 but it may amount to little more than <unk> the two have continued <unk> <unk> settlement talks over the last few weeks and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week 
 both warner and sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions 
 but the people familiar with the talks said that warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement 
 instead sony is likely to agree to let warner participate in certain of its businesses such as the record club of sony 's cbs records unit 
 warner has <unk> sony as the largest record company but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like cbs 
 the two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to columbia 's movies 
 in addition sony is expected to agree to swap columbia 's N N stake in the <unk> <unk> calif. studio that warner and columbia share in exchange for the old mgm studio lot that warner acquired with the purchase of <unk> <unk> corp 
 still it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week 
 one for example came from cbs records chairman walter yetnikoff who will head a committee that will oversee sony 's entertainment division including both records and movies 
 in his affidavit mr. yetnikoff accused warner chairman steven j. ross of having an <unk> <unk> bias and said that mr. ross had tried to talk him out of letting sony buy cbs records two years ago for that reason 
 mr. ross who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of time warner after the merger is complete denied that in his own affidavit and called mr. yetnikoff 's remarks vicious and his claims reckless irresponsible and <unk> saying warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in japan 
 mr. ross also said he enjoys warm professional and personal relationships with japanese executives including sony chairman <unk> <unk> who has visited my home here 
 but despite the <unk> between mr. ross and mr. yetnikoff officials of the time side of time warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities 
 time executives such as the company 's president n.j nicholas who will eventually be co-chief executive of time warner alongside mr. ross have no personal relationships or <unk> at stake in the fight over the guber-peters duo and were never directly drawn into the fray 
 talks between the two sides could <unk> of course as they have more than once since sony announced its plans to hire mr. guber and mr. peters 
 but both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue 
 and although warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract the producers said in sworn court <unk> that they did n't believe the relationship could be repaired after the <unk> of the legal battle 
 any settlement is also expected to exclude mr. guber and mr. peters from any of the projects they were working on at warner 
 the guber-peters duo have N projects in various stages of development and production at warner including <unk> of the <unk> and a bright <unk> lie 
 but that does n't mean mr. guber and mr. peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only N to N each year 
 once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development producers are typically free to take it elsewhere 
 mr. guber and mr. peters also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future <unk> to batman the blockbuster hit they produced for warner 
 but in acquiring guber-peters entertainment sony will actually get a piece of the profits from batman since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies mr. guber and mr. peters produce 
 the two producers own a combined N N stake in guber-peters 
 southern co. 's gulf power co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion and paid $ N in fines 
 gulf power 's guilty plea before u.s. district judge robert l. <unk> yesterday marks the end of only one part of a <unk> inquiry of southern co 
 the company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to <unk> federal income taxes 
 the terms announced today are strictly between the united states and gulf power said u.s. attorney robert l. <unk> 
 this is only a further step in a lengthy investigation 
 the plea settlement does not allow southern co. to charge any of the $ N to its customers or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry 
 gulf power had been under investigation for violating the utility holding company act which prohibits public utilities from making political contributions 
 in a statement southern co. president edward l. <unk> said we believe our decision to plead guilty to these charges is responsible and proper 
 and our action today will allow gulf power to avoid prolonged <unk> legal proceedings 
 he did not say what effect if any the $ N fine would have on the company 's earnings 
 mr. <unk> said yesterday 's plea by gulf power which came after months of negotiations was based on evidence that gulf power had set up an elaborate payment system through which it <unk> outside vendors primarily three florida advertising agencies for making illegal political contributions on its behalf 
 the <unk> agency for example allegedly made contributions from N to N to various funds for political candidates then submitted bills to gulf power 
 the contributions were funded by monthly payments of $ N to $ N to <unk> in the <unk> of a special production fee in effect <unk> the nature of the payments from the internal revenue service federal prosecutors said 
 the government also indicated that former gulf power senior vice president jacob f. <unk> <unk> was the <unk> behind the use of the ad agencies <unk> dick leonard group ii inc. and <unk> & <unk> corp. to make payments to various political candidates from N to N 
 mr. <unk> who <unk> gulf power 's <unk> efforts died <unk> in a plane crash in april after learning he might be fired following the <unk> of <unk> in a company audit

 frequent <unk> offer <unk> up <unk> debate 
 to grab a bigger piece of the declining <unk> market seagram co. has launched a controversial frequent <unk> promotion for its chivas <unk> brand 
 under the program dubbed chivas class customers who send in two labels from chivas bottles will receive an upgrade in <unk> class on some trans world airlines flights 
 repeat customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices 
 but at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse some liquor marketers consider seagram 's frequent buyer promotion risky 
 i 'm surprised they 're doing this says penn <unk> president of <unk> & <unk> co. which markets <unk> walker <unk> 
 i would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more you get more 
 others question the impact on chivas 's upscale image of a promotion that has customers <unk> off labels 
 it 's really bizarre says albert <unk> creative director at the wells rich greene ad agency 
 chivas has an image of something you would <unk> rather than <unk> 
 chivas class is n't the first such promotion 
 last year <unk> <unk> offered N <unk> frequent <unk> miles in exchange for a label 
 and <unk> 's gave discounts on scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels 
 but the scope of seagram 's chivas promotion sets it apart 
 the current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive <unk> direct marketing plan 
 seagram says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking 
 seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period says richard shaw vice president of u.s. direct marketing 
 we 're not asking them to save up N <unk>

 jewelry makers copy cosmetics sales <unk> 
 for years <unk> jewelry makers fought a losing battle 
 jewelry displays in department stores were often <unk> and <unk>

 last year the total women 's fashion jewelry business topped $ N billion says karen <unk> editor of accessories magazine

 they 're hiring models to <unk> the <unk> sporting their <unk> and they 're even beginning to borrow a <unk> favorite of the beauty business offering a gift when consumers make a purchase

 sun <unk> moon the korean <unk> who in N founded the unification church remains the mystery man behind a multimillion-dollar political and publishing operation based in this country and <unk> to the american right 
 but there may be less there than meets the eye 
 mr. moon planned to convert millions of americans to his unique brand of <unk> in which he plays the role of old <unk> <unk> political messiah and then to make the u.s. part of a unified international <unk> 
 his original strategy in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a <unk> was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various <unk> <unk> 
 tax-exempt airport and <unk> <unk> were intended only to provide start-up funds 
 more stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the moon movement in north america as they had in japan and south korea 
 then he would move his movement to europe 
 but that was not to be 
 throughout the 1970s and early 1980s spokesmen for both the unification church and its opponents in the <unk> movement gave wildly <unk> membership figures 
 their <unk> lives on 
 it is still common to read in the press that the church has N or more full-time american members and N associates 
 some estimates have gone as high as N members 
 but internal church documents clearly show that at its <unk> heights as when it organized a spectacular yankee stadium <unk> rally in N there actually were only about N full-time unification church members in the u.s. 
 mr. moon 's support for a <unk> richard nixon the <unk> scandal and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church 's <unk> efforts 
 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> kept member turnover high 
 that the membership number has even kept close to its N size is the result of the <unk> of the church 
 many of the enthusiastic young <unk> of the nixon era who remained <unk> to father moon are now parents producing new members by <unk> rather than conversion 
 the <unk> wealth of the unification church is another matter of <unk> 
 yet these purchases can be misleading 
 most were obtained with huge <unk> of church money from south korea and japan minimum cash <unk> and sizable mortgages 
 those teams of young <unk> selling flowers peanuts or <unk> outright at traffic <unk> brought in somewhere near $ N million a year during the <unk> 1970s but those revenues were a <unk> compared to the costs of mr. moon 's <unk> international conferences speaking tours and <unk> land buys 
 only his factories in japan and korea <unk> his <unk> at <unk> wages and producing everything from <unk> to <unk> to expensive marble <unk> kept the money flowing <unk> 
 virginia commonwealth university sociologist david <unk> who more than any other researcher has <unk> into the complex world of <unk> finances has concluded that profitable operations in the u.s. have been the exceptions rather than the rule 
 likewise journalists john burgess and michael <unk> of the washington post have estimated that at least $ N million was transferred from japan to the u.s. to deal with the church 's annual operating losses in this country 
 mr. moon 's two <unk> u.s. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain 
 start-up costs for the washington times alone were close to $ N million and the total amount lost in this <unk> black hole was estimated at $ N million by N 
 since then moon 's organization has <unk> a pair of high-quality glossy opinion magazines the world and i and insight which are a further drain 
 insiders say that not even their editors know for sure how much these <unk> publications along with the newspapers have cost mr. moon 
 many american <unk> businesses such as a $ N million factory to build fishing vessels are <unk> 
 some components of the american church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year 
 the relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests and press scrutiny in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and <unk> than the <unk> <unk> in fancy digs and exotic <unk> of years past 
 i attended several of these in the dual role as a <unk> of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts 
 mr. moon 's <unk> house eventually even published three of my <unk> books on <unk> and politics 
 according to veteran watchers of <unk> affairs such as dr. j. gordon <unk> director of the institute for the study of american <unk> almost all operations are being drastically reduced as mr. moon now <unk> more on developing his empire in the far east 
 everything one <unk> senior consultant to the unification church recently told me in an interview is going back to korea and japan 
 europe had proved even less <unk> than north america 
 european politicians were less reluctant to have their governments investigate and <unk> new <unk> 
 so mr. moon is in retreat <unk> on the far east 
 south korea and japan continue to be profitable 
 moon 's <unk> industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in china where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting <unk> even in the wake of the bloody massacre in <unk> square 
 <unk> motors is one such investment 
 according to senior consultants to the church mr. moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the chinese government to build an <unk> plant in <unk> province an area of china with a substantial korean minority 
 mr. moon has agreed to put up $ N million a year for N years and keep the profits in china 
 in return he has the government 's blessing to build <unk> and spread <unk> in that country 
 whatever respectability and ties to intellectuals and <unk> the publications and conferences bring really are salvage not the rev. moon 's original final goals but the ones for which he will have to settle 
 mr. <unk> is co-author with david g. <unk> of <unk> in america <unk> church and crusade and strange <unk> the great american <unk> scare

 debate on the legislation which faces a veto threat from president bush is to continue today 
 the amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who has run two or more carriers that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the bankruptcy code 
 in N texas air 's continental airlines filed for bankruptcy 
 earlier this year texas air 's eastern airlines filed for bankruptcy 
 this ought to be <unk> the do n't let frank lorenzo take over another airline amendment said rep. james <unk> d. minn. chairman of the house aviation subcommittee who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block <unk> deals 
 for years a strict <unk> <unk> the staff meetings at nissan motor co. 's technical center in tokyo 's western <unk> 
 employees wore <unk> <unk> listing not only their names but also their dates of hire 
 no one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first so younger employees often the most enthusiastic and innovative seldom spoke up at all 
 but in N the <unk> and the do n't speak out of turn rule were abolished early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the <unk> of a freight train 
 in recent years nissan has instituted <unk> work schedules and allowed employees to dress <unk> even in blue jeans 
 a rule <unk> staffers to own competitors ' cars has been lifted and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas 
 nissan 's <unk> corporate song filled with <unk> to mount fuji has been scrapped in favor of a <unk> tune sung by a popular japanese <unk> 
 and in a japanese corporate first nissan recently opened the first <unk> company <unk> for single employees at the suburban tokyo technical center 
 we had lots of internal debate about this one concedes <unk> <unk> a senior public-relations official 
 but in the end top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation 
 this corporate glasnost is a big reason nissan after years of making lackluster cars and <unk> profits has <unk> up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits ranging from the <unk> <unk> sedan and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> sold only in japan 
 the company 's turnaround is far from complete many crucial tests are just beginning 
 but its surprising progress so far holds important <unk> for companies in trouble 
 the big one a company 's culture ca n't be <unk> changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly <unk> and then publicly leads the charge 
 <unk> <unk> nissan 's executive vice president for finance helped set the tone in december N when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery 
 this is a time of <unk> to discover what is wrong with us he said 
 <unk> kume who took the helm as nissan 's president in june N added simply i am deeply disappointed 
 no wonder 
 nissan japan 's second-largest auto maker and the world 's <unk> was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival toyota motor corp. but also by honda motor co. the most successful japanese car company in the u.s. but a relative <unk> in japan 
 nissan 's market share in japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade 
 its u.s. sales sagged partly because of price increases due to the rising yen 
 worst of all nissan was <unk> with management <unk> <unk> and corporate <unk> 
 consider the experience of <unk> <unk> a <unk> designer of vehicle <unk> who joined nissan in N 
 at that time tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority 
 the oldest designer got to work on the <unk> she recalls 
 the next level down did doors 
 if a new person got to work on part of the <unk> that was a big deal 
 this system produced boring <unk> cars that consumers just were n't buying 
 desperately hoping to spark sales nissan transferred N middle managers and plant workers to dealerships 
 meanwhile president kume ordered everyone from top executives to <unk> designers to go town watching to visit <unk> parts of tokyo to try to gain <unk> into developing cars for <unk> 
 some <unk> <unk> were downright comic 
 one group of <unk> manufacturing men from the company 's <unk> plant outside tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city 
 but when they arrived at the door all were afraid to go in <unk> that they would be out of place 
 other trips were more productive 
 mr. kume himself visited honda 's headquarters in tokyo 's upscale <unk> district 
 he liked the <unk> lobby display of honda 's cars and trucks so much that he had nissan 's gloomy lobby exhibit <unk> 
 later nissan borrowed other honda practices including an engineering idea contest to promote <unk> 
 one engineer developed a <unk> car that moves <unk> 
 such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced but they seem to be genuine so much so in fact that some older employees have resisted 
 nissan handled the <unk> in a typically japanese fashion they were n't fired but instead were neglected says <unk> <unk> the personnel manager at the nissan technical center 
 despite the pain of adjusting the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars 
 a year ago the company completely revamped its <unk> sedan the $ N <unk> which competes against a broad range of upscale <unk> it replaced its <unk> <unk> body with <unk> <unk> lines 
 since then nissan also has launched new versions of the $ N <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> sports car 
 the <unk> <unk> costs as much as $ N and is <unk> off against the <unk> N which begins at $ N 
 besides new <unk> the new <unk> have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems 
 all three new models are <unk> their <unk> by wide margins 
 in its home market nissan has grabbed attention with <unk> <unk> featuring <unk> odd enough to be <unk> 
 one is the <unk> a tiny <unk> with a <unk> <unk> top and <unk> <unk> that give it a <unk> look 
 nissan initially planned to sell just N <unk> but sales have passed N and there 's a one-year waiting list for the car 
 then there 's the <unk> an <unk> delivery van with a <unk> body that inspired its name 
 nissan helped develop a tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme 
 the chairs are <unk> seats and a gift shop sells such items as alarm <unk> <unk> like the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> 
 all these vehicles have sharply improved nissan 's morale and image but have n't done much for its market share 
 nissan had N N of the japanese car market in N before beginning a <unk> <unk> slide that continued through last year 
 strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide but even the N N market share that nissan expects in N will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade 
 nissan concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market-share losses in japan until at least N and even that timetable might prove optimistic 
 everyone else is going to catch up with nissan 's innovative designs says a. <unk> <unk> auto analyst at first boston japan ltd 
 nissan 's pace of <unk> hits will slow he adds just as <unk> toyota <unk> its own batch of new cars 
 likewise in the u.s. nissan has grabbed N N of the car market so far this year up from N N a year ago 
 but even that brings nissan only to the share it had in N and leaves the company behind its high of N N in N and N 
 why 
 so far nissan 's <unk> successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential 
 in compact and <unk> cars the bread-and-butter sales <unk> for japanese auto makers nissan still trails toyota and honda 
 nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall with its new version of the stanza compact sedan 
 the stanza has been a <unk> compared with honda 's <unk> successful accord and toyota 's <unk> 
 but this year honda has revamped the accord and made it a midsized car 
 nissan instead has kept its new stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price N N at $ N stanza prices start $ N below the predecessor model yet have a <unk> engine 
 accord prices start at $ N 
 nissan 's risk is that its <unk> strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by detroit 's big three 
 but on a new car a <unk> does n't work well because it <unk> the vehicle 's image contends thomas d. <unk> executive vice president of nissan 's u.s. sales arm 
 even if the new stanza succeeds nissan will remain behind in the <unk> segment where its <unk> does n't measure up to the honda civic and toyota <unk> 
 nissan will introduce a completely revamped <unk> next fall 
 at the opposite end of the market nissan <unk> its luxury infiniti division on nov. N three years after honda <unk> japanese luxury cars and two months after toyota 's lexus went on sale 
 nissan started advertising infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit american <unk> 
 the ads featured <unk> rocks and <unk> <unk> almost anything but the cars themselves 
 the ads have generated some <unk> but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other u.s. auto advertising 
 on the other hand nissan 's sales goals for infiniti are modest compared with toyota 's targets for lexus 
 nissan will build only about N of the $ N infiniti <unk> <unk> each month sending about N of them to the u.s. and keeping the rest for sale in japan 
 toyota wants to sell about N lexus <unk> <unk> next year in the u.s. alone 
 when i saw the lexus sales projections i got worried <unk> <unk> <unk> who led the infiniti development team 
 but on reflection mr. <unk> says he concluded that nissan is being prudent in following its <unk> strategy instead of simply copying lexus 
 infiniti is nissan 's big business move for the <unk> century and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away mr. <unk> says 
 despite plans to add two new infiniti models next year bringing the total to four infiniti wo n't show profits for at least five years he adds 
 these days nissan can afford that strategy even though profits are n't exactly robust 
 nissan had record net income of N billion yen $ N million in the fiscal year ended last march N a remarkable recovery from the N billion yen of two years earlier when the company lost money on operations 
 nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales 
 but nissan expects to earn only N billion yen in the current fiscal year a modest increase of N N 
 the big reason for all its cost-cutting nissan remains less efficient than toyota 
 in its last fiscal year nissan 's profit represented just N N of sales compared with N N at toyota 
 to help close the gap nissan recently established a <unk> cost-cutting committee 
 nissan is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world 's key economic <unk> the u.s. japan and europe 
 that gives it an <unk> strategic advantage at least until its rivals catch up but also plenty of <unk> headaches 
 for example nissan 's u.s. operations include N separate subsidiaries for manufacturing sales design research etc. that report separately back to japan 
 and in july nissan 's tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a united auto workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter 
 we are in a <unk> phase from being a japanese company to becoming an international company based in japan says mr. <unk> the executive vice president 
 he promises that nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all u.s. operations just as it 's doing in europe 
 perhaps the biggest challenge however will be to prevent a return to its former corporate <unk> as its recovery continues 
 already personnel officials are talking about the need for a phase two <unk> effort of some sort 
 we are still only half way through the turnaround of this company and there are many more things to do president kume says 
 he adds however that the momentum we have generated is <unk> 
 as expected warner <unk> records said it agreed to form a <unk> and <unk> joint venture with former mca records chairman irving azoff 
 warner said it will provide financing for the venture but did n't disclose terms 
 mr. azoff has n't named the company yet but any records it produces will be distributed by warner 
 warner is part of warner communications inc. which is in the process of being acquired by time warner inc 
 mr. azoff resigned as head of mca records a unit of mca inc. in september and had been discussing a joint venture with both warner and mca 
 in a statement yesterday mr. azoff said he chose warner the largest record company because their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none 
 president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early december a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home 
 the white house is <unk> not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements 
 rather senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at mr. bush 's request because of his preference for conducting <unk> through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders 
 the two leaders will meet on dec. N and N <unk> the two days of meetings between a u.s. and a soviet naval vessel in the <unk> sea 
 the unusual <unk> meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed 
 in announcing the meeting yesterday mr. bush told reporters at the white house that neither he nor mr. gorbachev expects any substantial decisions or agreements 
 instead he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get better <unk> and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda 
 despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders 
 mr. gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home 
 american officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the u.s. could help bolster his <unk> among soviet politicians and <unk> whose support he needs 
 for his part mr. bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to mr. gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in eastern europe 
 a face-to-face meeting with mr. gorbachev should damp such criticism though it will hardly eliminate it 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine who has been the most prominent democratic critic of mr. bush 's handling of the soviet relationship praised the president for arranging the meeting 
 but he added the mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy 
 mr. bush said that the december meeting which was announced simultaneously in moscow will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the fanfare and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers 
 by doing it in this manner we can have i would say more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances things of that nature for public consumption mr. bush said 
 soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze at a news conference in moscow said as the two sides plan to hold a <unk> summit in late <unk> summer next year they found it useful i would say even necessary to hold an interim informal meeting 
 although no specific agreements are expected mr. shevardnadze said that does n't mean they will be without an agenda 
 if the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level u.s.-soviet meetings their talks would include human rights soviet reforms regional disputes relations with allies economic cooperation arms control and joint efforts to fight narcotics terrorism and pollution 
 the president specifically mentioned u.s. economic advice to moscow as a possible topic 
 mr. gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the u.s. to drop its restrictions on soviet trade 
 he recently told a small group of american businessmen in moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the u.s. possibly at the N summit 
 the soviets hope a trade agreement would give them <unk> nation status which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the u.s. 
 in an unusually <unk> article about the latest economic <unk> unemployment pravda yesterday reported that three million soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to N million by the year N 
 economists in moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits 
 but one bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the soviet economy or other issues 
 do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation or arms control or the environment he said 
 those things will all come up but in a fairly informal way 
 instead this official said this is vintage george bush 
 this was george bush 's own idea 
 it 's george bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly 
 aside from the soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms one other issue the soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions 
 western analysts say that given the meeting 's setting at sea gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the <unk> of both the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
 that theme has been a <unk> one for soviet military officials for much of this year 
 they argue that as the kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces the soviets ' area of greatest strength the u.s. should show more willingness to cut sea forces washington 's area of greatest <unk> 
 one of the reasons bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such <unk> structured <unk> gathering former president reagan 's N meeting with mr. gorbachev in <unk> <unk> 
 that meeting sent <unk> through the western alliance because mr. reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies 
 mr. bush said that he initiated talks with the soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to mr. gorbachev last july which the soviet leader readily accepted 
 but word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides and word of it did n't reach many <unk> officials until the past few days 
 indeed many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that mr. bush was n't interested in such an informal <unk> 
 though president bush 's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with mr. gorbachev it actually was the arguments of leaders within the soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the december meeting 
 mr. bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in europe in july with the leaders of poland and hungary who urged him to support mr. gorbachev 's efforts to transform the soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on eastern europe a senior aide said 
 while flying home from those discussions mr. bush drafted a letter to mr. gorbachev suggesting an informal <unk> to <unk> their formal summit next year 
 peter <unk> in moscow contributed to this article 
 <unk> <unk> del <unk> said its potential losses from lending to <unk> could reach N trillion lire $ N million marking the bank 's first <unk> of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its atlanta branch 
 bnl previously reported that its georgia branch had taken on loan commitments <unk> $ N billion without the <unk> management 's approval 
 state-owned bnl italy 's largest bank has filed charges against the branch 's former manager christopher <unk> and a former branch vice president alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties 
 bnl also said that its board had approved after an <unk> discussion a letter to the bank of italy <unk> measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches 
 the central bank had ordered bnl to come up with a suitable program by yesterday 
 bank of italy has also ordered bnl to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses and the rome bank has outlined a N trillion lire <unk> operation 
 bnl was unable to elaborate on what measures were planned by the bank to improve controls on its branches abroad 
 hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging <unk> protesters from some building or <unk> in one of our cities

 maybe he did n't start it but <unk> gandhi certainly provided a <unk> beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today 
 the <unk> or great <unk> one <unk> several campaigns of passive resistance against the british government in india 
 unfortunately according to webster 's <unk> <unk> his policies went beyond his control and resulted in <unk> and <unk> and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience resulted in <unk> and a second <unk> 
 i am not a <unk> of everything gandhi did but some of his law breaking was justified because india was then under <unk> by a foreign power and indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that <unk> affected them 
 it is difficult however to justify civil disobedience non-violent or not where citizens have full <unk> to the ballot box to effect change 
 where truly representative governments are <unk> by constitutional <unk> of human rights and an independent judiciary to <unk> those rights there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group <unk> with it 
 there may be a few cases where the law breaking is well <unk> and so completely <unk> of the rights of others that it is difficult to <unk> it 
 the case of <unk> parks the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus comes to mind as an illustration 
 but most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign 
 the public has a tendency to <unk> <unk> demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience 
 it is true that both are non-violent but there is a fundamental difference between them 
 <unk> demonstrations such as peaceful <unk> and other <unk> that do not <unk> the peace or cause a public <unk> or interfere with the rights of others are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government 
 civil disobedience violent or non-violent is <unk> law breaking 
 the subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience but before we get on with that let me make just a few <unk> remarks about <unk> demonstrations 
 they are useful to call public attention to <unk> but they have little value in <unk> anyone about the issues in dispute 
 the <unk> of television in dramatic confrontation encourages <unk> of <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> gestures <unk> signs and other <unk> inspired tactics 
 <unk> <unk> and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture <unk> by <unk> media interviews 
 at best demonstrations are <unk> and <unk> <unk> at worst they can become the <unk> that lead to law breaking 
 demonstrations are particularly apt to <unk> into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the <unk> and become mobile 
 <unk> criminals and street people looking for excitement <unk> themselves like <unk> to the <unk> of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing auto <unk> <unk> window breaking <unk> <unk> picking and general <unk> 
 soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in <unk> mania 
 there are better ways to promote a cause 
 where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece rather than a <unk> demonstration that may only attract crime it is difficult to justify 
 some find no harm in the <unk> of trespass minor property destruction blocking traffic and the like 
 they say these are small prices to pay for <unk> action for the <unk> cause 
 the crimes may appear small but the prices can be huge 
 here are two cases to illustrate 
 assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a <unk> accident involving a police car 
 the protesters lie down in the street blocking traffic and will not move until the authorities carry them away 
 assume that someone caught in the <unk> has a heart attack 
 there is no way to get an <unk> in quickly to move him to a hospital 
 he dies 
 the demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple <unk> but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal 
 assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience 
 the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of <unk> amid certain groups 
 in a planned protest against his appearance several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv cameras in such a way that the program can not continue 
 the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige 
 the demonstrators have been non-violent but the result of their <unk> has been to seriously <unk> the rights of others <unk> with their dispute 
 it might be alleged that tv has done more than its share to <unk> and promote non-violent civil disobedience so the second situation <unk> above would be simply a case of <unk> coming home to <unk> 
 or maybe the tv network would lose nothing 
 <unk> or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the <unk> protesters 
 let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only <unk> other people indirectly yet does <unk> damage to the nation as a whole 
 i am referring to those young men who chose to <unk> their country 's call to arms during the vietnam war and fled to canada or some other <unk> to avoid combat 
 their <unk> acts of civil disobedience which they tried to hide under the <unk> of <unk> at a war they characterized as <unk> weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served <unk> in that conflict 
 even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their <unk> thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy <unk> 
 it is amazing that the <unk> mass executions in vietnam and cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally <unk> 
 worse it remained to a <unk> but <unk> president of the united states to <unk> the final <unk> upon those who fought and died in vietnam 
 under the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the nation president carter <unk> thousands of draft <unk> thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's <unk> 
 the precedent having been set who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the u.s. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war <unk> and <unk> until it is over 
 finally i think it important to point out the extraordinarily high <unk> of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage 
 give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law and no second invitation will be required 
 this brings into question the <unk> of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations 
 do they want the <unk> for themselves or for their cause 
 here is a good rule of <unk> if the movement produced the leader the chance that he is <unk> is much greater than if the leader produced the movement 
 in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience 
 if you have not it is probable that a <unk> airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course 
 mr. <unk> was vice president of the u.s. from N until he resigned in N 
 gov. george deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary <unk> increase in the state sales tax to raise $ N million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake 
 the tax increase which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow would cover only part of the estimated $ N billion to $ N billion in total damage caused by the oct. N quake 
 aside from as much as $ N billion in recently approved federal aid the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $ N million 
 i am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general <unk> of the <unk> plan said a spokesman for the governor after a monday meeting with legislative leaders over the <unk> question 
 the tax increase on top of the current <unk> per dollar sales tax would become effective this dec. N and expire dec. N N 
 the <unk> plan was preferred over an alternative that would have boosted the state gasoline tax 
 some legislators expressed concern that a <unk> increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major <unk> ballot initiative that voters will consider next june

 after a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings <unk> attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in north america brazil and korea 
 those gains came from higher prices particularly for disposable <unk> and tissue products and from increased sales primarily for <unk> products the company said 
 newsprint results continued to be depressed the company added because of industrywide price discounting 
 the <unk> comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period including $ N million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in alabama 
 in the N period also interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago

 that may leave a lot of <unk> for u.s. bankruptcy judge burton r. <unk> to decide what if anything the pilots actually collect 
 in august he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their <unk> <unk> before the arbitrator 
 the pilots ' contract with eastern calls for a <unk> acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such <unk> 
 in a statement to employees eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling 
 the obligation is totally unwarranted the statement said 
 james <unk> a lawyer for the air line pilots association said the pilots were extremely pleased 
 this is a blow not only to eastern but to the creditors committee he said 
 eastern 's creditors committee along with the company has consistently opposed the pilots ' claim which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims 
 eastern and its creditors are in the final delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts 
 an earlier plan which had received the creditors ' approval in july fell apart when eastern changed its business plan 
 it is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan 
 the dispute between eastern and its pilots is over a pay parity clause in the pilots ' contract 
 the clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise 
 shortly after texas air took control of eastern some machinists union supervisors received a N N pay raise 
 the pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them 
 eastern has disputed the claim but a federal district court an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all <unk> with the pilots 
 the two sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue 
 the pilots put the amount as high as $ N million the company at $ N million 
 another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between eastern and its pilots resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union 
 a decision on that case is n't expected before <unk> 
 ironically many of the pilots involved have left eastern or are still striking the carrier which filed for bankruptcy protection march N 
 about N have crossed the picket lines and returned to work 
 few people in the advertising business have raised as many <unk> as alvin a. achenbaum 
 the general public may not know his name but he 's famous make that <unk> in advertising circles a marketing consultant he <unk> slashing ad agency commissions to the <unk> of advertising clients and the <unk> of agencies 
 now after beating them mr. achenbaum is joining them 
 backer spielvogel bates worldwide named mr. achenbaum N vice chairman of professional services reporting directly to carl spielvogel chairman and chief executive officer 
 he joins nov. N <unk> his consulting firm <unk> achenbaum associates 
 in years past the ad industry 's most distinguished executives did n't hesitate to <unk> mr. achenbaum 
 they have since <unk> although one senior young & rubicam executive <unk> others said i think ad agencies owe carl spielvogel a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business 
 but industry executives also believe hiring mr. achenbaum is a <unk> move for backer spielvogel a unit of saatchi & saatchi 
 mr. achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country including nissan toyota seagram and backer spielvogel clients hyundai and j.p. morgan 
 at backer spielvogel he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies aside from agency compensation issues he helped nissan for example come up with its <unk> and pricing for its new infiniti line 
 his client contacts meanwhile could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late 
 i 've done over N ad agency searches for clients so i have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency mr. achenbaum said 
 as a consultant he has given <unk> at agencies including ogilvy & mather on how to win new business 
 mr. spielvogel said he hopes mr. achenbaum will do some strategic consulting at the agency for <unk> in hopes that they become clients 
 at backer spielvogel mr. spielvogel 's <unk> has been personal involvement with all major clients 
 he <unk> them he invites them to <unk> parties he strokes them 
 mr. achenbaum too <unk> into his clients ' business 
 carl has a much higher degree of <unk> with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size 
 and with al 's record of being a <unk> and a detail guy you can see how the two fit said alan <unk> an analyst with painewebber 
 mr. achenbaum 's move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner stanley <unk> N would retire 
 when the announcement came out i picked up the phone and said why do n't you come to us mr. spielvogel said 
 mr. achenbaum who had been considering <unk> down his firm or <unk> it with another small consulting outfit soon agreed 
 the two men are longtime friends and tennis partners having met about N years ago 
 before becoming a consultant in N mr. achenbaum was a senior executive at j. walter thompson co 
 he spent most of his career <unk> marketing strategies but became best-known for <unk> away at ad agency compensation 
 ad agencies typically earned a straight N N commission if a client spent $ N million on tv time the agency made $ N million 
 but mr. achenbaum <unk> negotiated fees which often worked out to less than N N 
 more recently he negotiated <unk> <unk> in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account 
 he ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation however that clients did n't seek him out for anything else 
 i was very frustrated he said 
 the fact of the matter is i am a marketer 
 that 's another reason for the backer spielvogel job 
 it struck me as a way to get back to what i really want to do 
 mr. spielvogel added <unk> the pressure on commissions did n't begin with al achenbaum 
 mr. spielvogel said mr. achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion merchandising publicity and other marketing outlets and to integrate those services 
 he will concentrate on among others j.p. morgan and hyundai 
 mr. achenbaum helped morgan in its recent agency search and he has a long relationship with hyundai which is having severe troubles including declining sales 
 the trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising and going <unk> other services mr. spielvogel said 
 instead of being just an ad agency he said we have <unk> our mission here 
 our mission is to help our clients grow and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that 
 industry executives are <unk> mr. achenbaum well 
 leonard matthews <unk> of the american association of advertising agencies called mr. achenbaum a <unk> in an <unk> N speech 
 yesterday mr. matthews now a consultant with the stamford conn. firm matthews & johnston <unk> i think he 'll be very good at that new job 
 and much better at that than at the <unk> he 's been doing recently

 cotton inc. 's new $ N million campaign calls cotton the fabric of our lives 
 the campaign <unk> its take comfort in cotton ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts

 with the new tv spots ogilvy & mather has opted for a family style with lots of <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 we 're making a fairly obvious plea for some emotional reaction says tom <unk> creative director at ogilvy & mather

 prime minister lee <unk> <unk> singapore 's leader and one of asia 's leading <unk> for N years recently announced his intention to retire next year though not necessarily to end his influence 
 the prime minister whose hair is <unk> and gray and whose face has a perpetual <unk> nonetheless continues to display an energy a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other asian leaders <unk> say only privately 
 the <unk> mr. lee recently spent an hour discussing the state of asia and the world with two journal reporters in his <unk> <unk> <unk> office 
 the interview did not touch on singapore 's domestic affairs 
 <unk> personal <unk> mr. lee picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier before the government crackdown in china when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in beijing feared a <unk> of views 
 <unk> follow 
 on china 's turmoil it is a very unhappy scene he said 
 it took <unk> <unk> former premier and party chief N years to build a team of economists who understood how the western economies work and now that team is part in <unk> part being <unk> and part missing 
 rebuilding that team mr. lee predicted will take another N years 
 that 's very sad for china and for asia because china could have been a good engine for growth not just for hong kong and taiwan but for japan korea and the rest of asia 
 on <unk> between china and the soviet union in important <unk> the soviets are different from the chinese 
 they are already industrialized 
 their problem is one of <unk> of an industrial economy 
 the chinese problem is much greater it 's how to <unk> to begin with 
 asked if the soviets like chinese officials wo n't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to <unk> economically and yet retain political control mr. lee said i would think that the soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in <unk> than the chinese i mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world 
 mikhail gorbachev he said is ahead of china 's leaders in his awareness of the world 
 but i think the soviet peoples are more <unk> than the chinese 
 regardless he said he still believes the soviet union while falling far short of the efficiency of a western economy may well manage to improve considerably 
 on <unk> prosperity if america can keep up the present situation her markets open for another N years with adjustments and japan can grow and not cut back and so too korea taiwan hong kong singapore <unk> australia and new zealand then in N years the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves 
 in such an arrangement all benefit he said 
 and if the europeans come in they benefit too 
 it 's not a <unk> game 
 asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among <unk> nations which will be discussed nov. N and N at a <unk> meeting in <unk> mr. lee said the goal is to have a free and open world trading system 
 an asian bloc is n't intended he said 
 that 's not possible 
 on <unk> relations i 'm encouraged 
 i think the earlier <unk> notes struck by u.s. commerce secretary robert mosbacher and u.s. trade representative carla hills have been more <unk> 
 i believe the u.s. is becoming more patient and <unk> he said 
 it 's the total relationship that is important 
 the total relationship as mr. lee sees it is the flow of dollars to the u.s. to fund the deficits the investments the japanese are making in the u.s. in order to satisfy american demand that american products consumed in america should be made as much as possible in america by americans with japanese technology and capital 
 japan 's recent political turbulence mr. lee said may mean japan will slow market adjustments 
 they 'll be more <unk> in <unk> their own voters like opening up more to agricultural imports from america hurting their farmers 
 on u.s. military presence in asia asked if his offer to allow the american military to use facilities in singapore would help preserve america 's presence in the region at bases in the philippines he said what we have done is make it easier for the philippines to continue to host american bases without it being said they are <unk> of the <unk> and the only ones in asia or in southeast asia 
 we are willing to share the political burden of being host to america an imperial power 
 we think it is n't such a great burden that it carries no <unk> and we are prepared to do it 
 on <unk> relations it 's such a <unk> relationship going back into history 
 i really do not understand how it is that <unk> feel so <unk> involved in this father figure that they want to <unk> of and yet they need 
 i just do n't understand it 
 my relationships with the british are totally different 
 they <unk> it over me 
 they did me some good 
 they did themselves even more good 
 they let me down when the japanese came down during world war ii 
 i do n't feel down or done in because i show british <unk> on my television network or read their books 
 i mean it is a normal adult relationship 
 but the <unk> and the americans when i talk to them there 's so much passion about filipino <unk> being diminished as a result of being <unk> upon by the americans and so on 
 the <unk> <unk> tries to put on <unk> but we let it pass 
 it 's just comic when they try to <unk> they 're still the master race 
 mr. lee added that the <unk> are making it very difficult for the u.s. military presence to last beyond five or N years 
 on military alternatives if the u.s. pulls back the soviets already are present 
 i <unk> sooner or later the japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side 
 maybe the chinese maybe even the indians 
 on economic consequences of a diminished u.s. presence america is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties 
 asked why so few nations seem to share his views of america he said many people see it that way 
 but they have just taken it for granted 
 on cambodia let 's assume that former <unk> leader prince <unk> <unk> does what the press wants him to do and joins up with <unk> <unk> leader <unk> sen 
 is the trouble over 
 can <unk> and <unk> sen knock off the khmer rouge still supported by china 
 he ca n't 
 what is the way forward 
 to get the khmer rouge as part of a process for elections 
 and when they lose then we can expect china to stop aid 
 let 's put it <unk> 
 the chinese can not be seen to have made use of the khmer rouge and then <unk> them 
 ms. house is vice president of dow jones international group 
 mr. <unk> is editor of the asian wall street journal 
 everything looked good as <unk> walter levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's <unk> tumor at the cleveland clinic in N 
 using small electrical shocks applied to her feet they were able to monitor <unk> nerves 
 the shocks generated <unk> <unk> that traveled via <unk> to brain and showed up clearly on a <unk> monitor indicating no damage to the delicate <unk> tissue 
 then says dr. levy she <unk> up <unk> 
 the damage was to her motor nerves which could n't be monitored along with the <unk> nerves he explains 
 the tragedy he adds galvanized me to look for a way to prevent similar cases 
 dr. levy 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe a device that he and dozens of u.s. researchers are studying with great hope 
 besides holding the promise of safer <unk> surgery the probe could improve the <unk> of brain and <unk> disorders such as strokes and multiple <unk> 
 perhaps most exciting the device is <unk> open a window to the workings of the brain 
 the probe which is <unk> <unk> and apparently <unk> employs strong magnetic fields to induce small <unk> of electricity within the brain 
 if positioned over the brain 's <unk> area the hand-held <unk> generate <unk> <unk> that zip down motor nerves and <unk> <unk> making say a finger <unk> 
 in principle they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system the way an <unk> tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them 
 until now we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function says keith <unk> a <unk> conducting clinical tests with the devices at boston 's massachusetts general hospital 
 all we could do was tell a patient squeeze my fingers as hard as you can or raise your arm 
 under the best circumstances such tests are <unk> when a patient is <unk> they do n't work at all 
 magnetic brain <unk> started in the early <unk> when researchers produced <unk> of light in the <unk> field with <unk> 
 in the 1960s <unk> clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other <unk> 
 but for brain tests the <unk> machines would have required patients to stand on their heads says <unk> <unk> a researcher at the university of california at san diego 
 the field took off in N after scientists at britain 's <unk> university developed a handy compact <unk> for brain <unk> 
 since then at least two commercial versions have been put on the u.s. market and an estimated N have been sold 
 in august a chicago conference on such devices attracted more than N researchers who reported studies on everything from brain <unk> to physical therapy 
 we do n't feel we can use the devices routinely in surgery yet but we 're getting close says dr. levy who is now with the university of pittsburgh 
 a problem he adds is that <unk> brains are more <unk> to magnetic <unk> than <unk> ones 
 the devices could help indicate when surgery would help says charles <unk> a university of toronto <unk> 
 for example <unk> <unk> victims occasionally have some intact <unk> <unk> that if <unk> by emergency surgery enable partial recovery 
 but such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial 
 the cost of magnetic stimulators would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve <unk> function in such people dr. <unk> says 
 scientists caution there is a chance the <unk> technique might spark seizures in <unk> 
 but no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices 
 the main <unk> besides feeling like a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> is like a <unk> on the head says sam <unk> a <unk> who has studied the brain stimulators at yale university 
 one apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain <unk> 
 and some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches 
 at least two companies <unk> laboratories inc. of <unk> wash. and <unk> medical systems inc. of <unk> conn. now sell versions of the magnetic devices 
 the machines which at $ N are <unk> by medical standards have n't been approved in the u.s. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for <unk> nerves in the hand <unk> and other <unk> areas 
 researchers can apply for permission to use the <unk> for brain studies 
 at the university of kentucky a team led by dean <unk> a physical therapy researcher is testing the stimulators in <unk> with electric shocks to induce muscle <unk> to help prevent <unk> of <unk> <unk> after <unk> surgery 
 similarly a <unk> university team led by heart researcher <unk> <unk> hopes to develop ways to <unk> induce <unk> muscle <unk> 
 the devices might someday serve as temporary <unk> or <unk> for stopped hearts says dr. <unk> whose prototype was dubbed the <unk> <unk> 
 the devices ' most remarkable possibilities though involve the brain 
 probing with the stimulators national institutes of health scientists recently showed how the brain <unk> <unk> resources after an <unk> 
 similar studies are expected to reveal how <unk> patients ' brains <unk> a first step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation 
 scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines 
 at the state university of new york at brooklyn researchers <unk> two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs 
 between <unk> certain areas in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic <unk> 
 when the jolt is <unk> just right the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters 
 where does that first <unk> go <unk> <unk> <unk> paul <unk> 
 trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories such as precisely where and how the brain processes <unk> signals from the eyes 
 he and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory 
 both the <unk> team and researchers at the national <unk> laboratory in cambridge mass. are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators 
 among other things the stronger devices may be able to <unk> forth <unk> memories and induce mood changes <unk> say 
 du pont co. hewlett-packard co. and los <unk> national laboratory said they signed a three-year $ N million agreement to <unk> on superconductor research

 the materials discovered during the past three years conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller faster computers and other new technologies 
 <unk> programs have <unk> as u.s. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of <unk> new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign <unk> especially in japan

 west germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of jan. N N economics minister helmut <unk> said 
 he said the government will also repeal the N N transaction tax on the first-time purchase of stakes in companies 
 the announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the european community at the end of N 
 the <unk> tax has been long criticized by the west german financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of frankfurt into rival financial centers especially london where trading transactions is n't taxed 
 the tax has raised less than one billion marks $ N million annually in recent years but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns 
 in the interview mr. <unk> did n't specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears 
 the new date means that the tax will be officially <unk> before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of N and guarantees its <unk> even if the current <unk> coalition loses the elections in december N 
 earlier this year president bush made a final <unk> it offer on the minimum wage an increase to $ N an hour over three years and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job 
 now the white house has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years 
 the <unk> wage would apply only to first-time <unk> workers for N days 
 the white house had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation 
 the only permanent losers will be the N or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $ N rate congress is likely to approve today 
 it is <unk> such as this that convince washington 's liberals that if they simply stay the course this administration will <unk> from its own course on this and other issues 
 the head trader of chemical banking corp. 's interest-rate options group has left the company following valuation errors that resulted in a $ N million charge against its third-quarter results 
 chemical said steven <unk> resigned recently but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced 
 mr. <unk> could n't be reached for comment 
 a separate inquiry by chemical cleared mr. <unk> of allegations that he had been <unk> <unk> by a new york money broker 
 that inquiry has n't resolved similar allegations involving another chemical options trader 
 in other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit 
 chemical named james kennedy a trader in swaps contracts for the bank to assume mr. <unk> 's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products including swaps and interest-rate options 
 lee <unk> vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to <unk> out the mess resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at continental bank in chicago 
 mr. <unk> whom chemical tried to keep did n't return calls for comment 
 separately chemical confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on <unk> agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in frankfurt west germany 
 a chemical spokeswoman said the second-quarter charge was not material and that no personnel changes were made as a result 
 the spokeswoman said the frankfurt situation was totally different from problems in the interest-rate options unit 
 according to individuals familiar with the situation the frankfurt loss stemmed from a computer program for <unk> prices on <unk> agreements that failed to <unk> an interest-rate environment where short-term rates were equal to or higher than long-term rates 
 while the incidents involving interest-rate options and <unk> agreements are unrelated some observers say they echo a N incident in which bankers trust new york corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $ N million 
 these complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions 
 in an interest-rate options contract a client pays a fee to a bank for <unk> protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period 
 in a <unk> agreement a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction 
 some competitors maintain the <unk> option loss in particular may have resulted more from chemical 's taking large and often <unk> positions than a valuation problem 
 started three years ago chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field 
 from N to N the value of chemical 's option contracts outstanding <unk> to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 more <unk> the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost <unk> 
 with such a <unk> book of options traders say chemical was more vulnerable to <unk> valuation assumptions 
 the chemical spokeswoman said the bank has examined its <unk> and internal controls 
 we consider our internal controls to have worked well she said adding that some procedures have been strengthened 
 its valuation <unk> she said are recognized as some of the best on the street 
 not a lot was needed to be done 
 when thomas w. wathen went big league last year he acquired a <unk> of <unk> along with a well-known but ailing security business pinkerton 's inc 
 there was a wanted <unk> offering rewards for the arrest of express and train <unk> frank james and <unk> w. james and the original pinkerton 's <unk> with an open eye and the <unk> we never sleep which inspired the phrase private eye 
 then there were two gold watches once owned by <unk> pinkerton who founded the company in chicago in N 
 but there were supposed to be three mr. wathen 's company claims 
 the missing watch is <unk> of the problems mr. wathen encountered in building his closely held california plant protection security service into the largest <unk> and security agency in the u.s. through acquisitions 
 the <unk> mr. wathen has learned that while acquiring a big <unk> company can be a <unk> to growth it can also bring a host of <unk> problems 
 we cleared out a lot of <unk> ' <unk> says the <unk> security veteran 
 mr. wathen who started his career as an air force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies built his california plant protection from a tiny <unk> security <unk> firm here in the san fernando valley 
 he joined the firm in N and bought it from the owners the next year 
 over the next N years california plant protection opened N offices around the country 
 yet although california plant protection was <unk> bigger and bigger clients the firm provided security for the N summer olympics in los angeles it still did n't have the name recognition of pinkerton 's 
 so when american brands inc. decided to sell the unit in N as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations mr. wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives 
 he decided he could easily merge pinkerton 's operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities 
 he could acquire a staff of loyal pinkerton 's employees many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he 'd wanted 
 mr. wathen also <unk> the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself who 'd spent his whole career in the security business could run pinkerton 's better than an <unk> conglomerate or investment banker 
 the security business is my favorite subject 
 i love this business he says 
 most of the lbo guys do n't know how to run a business anyway 
 but there were <unk> not the least of which was that mr. wathen says he <unk> almost <unk> in doing the $ N million acquisition which was completed in january N 
 we were n't allowed to do any due <unk> because of competitive reasons 
 if we had it might have scared us off he says 
 five years of rapid expansion under american brands with an emphasis on marketing the agency 's services instead of improving them had hurt pinkerton 's profits mr. wathen claims 
 he says his team could n't tell whether accounts <unk> had been paid or not 
 pinkerton 's had locked itself into <unk> contracts to win new business with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired he adds 
 and regional offices were <unk> <unk> he claims 
 one office had N people doing the work of three and half of the employees had company automobiles 
 american brands declined to comment on mr. wathen 's accusations 
 the acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company pinkerton 's with N sales of $ N million and the fourth largest california plant protection with $ N million in sales creating the industry 's biggest firm which took on the pinkerton 's name 
 even after <unk> itself of $ N million of unprofitable business the new pinkerton 's will have sales of about $ N million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of N N of sales says lloyd <unk> of <unk> & co. in los angeles which arranged the pinkerton 's acquisition 
 mr. wathen says his turnaround strategy has been simple just <unk> away at the fat 
 he began by closing N of the combined companies ' N offices in two months eliminating about N N of the company 's <unk> <unk> staff including more than N sales positions 
 he shut down the company 's tony new york headquarters 
 pinkerton 's world headquarters today is a <unk> <unk> office building across the street from the small van <unk> airport 
 next mr. wathen raised pinkerton 's rates which were <unk> lower than california plant protection 's average rate of around $ N 
 and he got rid of <unk> businesses that just were n't making money for the company 
 mr. wathen who says pinkerton 's had a loss of nearly $ N million in N under american brands boasts that he 's made pinkerton 's profitable again 
 but mr. wathen 's team still must pay down about $ N million of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years 
 last year earnings of the combined companies did n't cover debt service and pinkerton 's was forced to borrow $ N million of subordinated debt 
 we would n't have had to <unk> if a lot of the problems had n't been there mr. wathen says 
 this year mr. wathen says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit 
 now pinkerton 's could become <unk> in a <unk> legal <unk> with its former parent 
 the company recently filed suit in state court in los angeles against american brands seeking at least $ N million in damages from the old greenwich <unk> company 
 the suit alleges that american brands <unk> the financial condition of pinkerton 's before the sale failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which pinkerton 's was in default had n't registered the pinkerton 's name and trademark in the united kingdom and did n't tell california plant protection about some labor <unk> 
 we have previously had discussions with representatives of pinkerton 's inc. concerning the sale of the company and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract says american brands 
 as this is now a litigation matter we have no further comment 
 and then there 's the case of the missing gold watch 
 the lawsuit alleges that an inventory of pinkerton 's <unk> disclosed that one of the watches had n't been <unk> over by american brands 
 american brand 's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new pinkerton 's in an amount as yet to be determined and deprived it of a valuable <unk> for which it had <unk> the suit charges 
 the key to pinkerton 's future will be sticking to what it does best being a security company says mr. wathen 
 the company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations particularly <unk> investigations for corporations 
 although investigations now account for only about N N of pinkerton 's total revenue that side of the business has traditionally been the more glamorous of the two and it carries historical and <unk> value 
 author <unk> <unk> who wrote the <unk> falcon was a former pinkerton 's <unk> 
 american brands just had a different approach mr. wathen says 
 their approach did n't work mine is

 paramount which agreed to sell the unit in july said it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $ N billion with an after-tax gain of $ N billion 
 paramount said the gain would be recorded in its fourth quarter which ended yesterday 
 paramount said the sale <unk> the strategic restructuring it began in N and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses

 sea containers ltd. in a long-awaited move to <unk> a hostile takeover bid said it will sell $ N billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about N N of its common shares for $ N apiece 
 together with the N million shares currently controlled by management subsidiaries and directors the completed tender offer would give sea containers a controlling stake 
 describing itself as asset rich sea containers said it will move immediately to sell two ports various <unk> ferry services containers and other investments 
 of the proceeds $ N million will be used to fund its tender offer 
 sea containers added that the recapitalization plan will reduce its debt by more than $ N million 
 the company which has N million common shares outstanding said in <unk> that it was considering a restructuring to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns 
 in late may <unk> holding ag and <unk> plc launched a $ <unk> or $ N million tender offer for the hamilton <unk> sea containers 
 in <unk> the companies through their jointly owned holding company temple holdings ltd. sweetened the offer to $ N a share or $ N million 
 officials for temple declined to comment 
 news of the restructuring plan sent sea containers ' shares up $ N to $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 walter <unk> an analyst with painewebber inc. said that offering holders a higher $ <unk> price is a fairly effective method of blocking the <unk> bid 
 michael <unk> an analyst with tucker anthony & <unk> day added that the sale of assets would allow sea containers to focus on its core container businesses 
 for holders who decide not to tender their shares sea containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $ N plus a cash dividend on the common stock 
 the company said its directors management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and wo n't tender any of their shares under the offer 
 sea containers said the offer will proceed after the <unk> supreme court <unk> or <unk> an interim injunction <unk> the company from buying its shares 
 that injunction resulted from litigation between temple and sea containers last may 
 the company said the court has indicated it will make a decision on or about nov. N

 you 'd think all the stories about <unk> communities and developers getting hud grants would prompt congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies 
 no way 
 congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the <unk> federal housing administration 
 it appears that the only thing congress is learning from the hud story is how to <unk> its control of the <unk> pot going to special interests 
 right now the largest loan the fha can insure in <unk> housing markets is $ N 
 last week housing <unk> persuaded congress to raise the ceiling to $ N making fha loans more accessible to the <unk> 
 but it does that at the cost of <unk> the taxpayer 's exposure if the fha is forced to pay for more loans going sour 
 this is no idle fear last year the fha lost $ N billion in loan defaults 
 but the higher mortgage ceiling is only the <unk> <unk> for what senator alan cranston and majority leader george mitchell have in mind for housing 
 the senate banking committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs 
 other senators want to lower the down payments required on <unk> loans 
 that would be a formula for ensuring even more fha red ink 
 experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a <unk> default is the down payment 
 because a <unk> can use an fha loan to finance all points and closing costs the fha can wind up lending more than a house is worth 
 if housing prices continue to fall many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses 
 much the same thing happened with <unk> s&ls a problem congress just solved with a $ N billion bailout 
 we hear that hud secretary jack kemp is <unk> with going along with some of the <unk> proposals 
 that sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next hud <unk> pit 
 a group of N senators has written mr. kemp urging him to reject <unk> and focus on programs that <unk> the poor rather than create vast new government obligations 
 but even if he agrees mr. kemp does n't write the nation 's housing law congress does 
 and the majority of members <unk> view the current <unk> of hud as mainly a chance to <unk> through their own slate of projects 
 exhibit a is last week 's house vote to fund N pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the hud scandal 
 none of the grants had been requested by hud <unk> <unk> or were the subject of a single hearing 
 more and more observers now realize that the key to ending future hud scandals lies in forcing congress to clean up its own act 
 this week a baltimore sun editorial said the <unk> subcommittee on hud should forget about sam <unk> 's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses the various congressional sponsors of the N pork-barrel projects 
 the sun concluded that mr. <unk> is only part of the problem and a part that 's gone 
 if hud is to be <unk> it concluded members of congress will have to start looking into and doing something about the practices of their colleagues 
 of course <unk> is about the last thing this congress is interested in 
 proponents of expanding fha programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets 
 but the fha program is hemorrhaging bad loans 
 jack kemp has submitted a package of reforms and they are surely headed for the capitol hill <unk> 
 like the s&l mess before it this is a problem congress should be solving not ignoring

 ocean drilling & exploration co. will sell its <unk> business and took a $ N million loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter because of the planned sale 
 the new orleans oil and gas exploration and <unk> operations company added that it does n't expect any further adverse financial impact from the restructuring 
 in the third quarter the company which is <unk> by murphy oil corp. of arkansas had a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a restated loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year ago

 after N years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care system <unk> seidman of the <unk> is finding interest from an unlikely quarter big business 
 corporate leaders frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs are beginning to sound like liberal democrats 
 failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to <unk> our thinking and positions with respect to <unk> national health insurance arthur <unk> a general electric co. vice president warned earlier this year 
 the <unk> impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus 
 both the <unk> and the national association of manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs improve quality and provide care to the N million americans who currently lack health insurance 
 agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program and nobody expects the u.s. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system 
 but there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine 
 i ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is says mr. seidman who heads the <unk> 's department dealing with health matters 
 because the bush administration is n't taking the initiative on health issues business executives are dealing with congressional democrats who champion health-care revision 
 business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue says sen. edward kennedy d. mass 
 it 's a <unk> issue 
 business complained earlier this year when sen. kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain <unk> measures 
 partly in response a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is <unk> a plan to attract broader support 
 it will feature a <unk> provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices

 labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums <unk> and <unk> to <unk> surging medical costs to workers 
 health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against pittston co. and nynex corp

 some analysts are <unk> about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul 
 carl <unk> president of the health insurance association of america <unk> at capitalists who want to <unk> the entire financing system for health 
 they hope they can buy some government cost discipline but this is a false hope mr. <unk> says 
 he asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business 
 so far neither the bush administration nor congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care 
 the administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy 
 congress still is struggling to <unk> the unpopular catastrophic care act of N which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage 
 a bipartisan commission established by congress and headed by sen. john rockefeller d. <unk> is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next march N

 it is expected to report next summer 
 no magic bullet will be discovered next year an election year says rep. <unk> stark d. calif 
 but N could be a window for action 
 the pressure for change will rise with costs 
 i think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change says sharon <unk> a health expert at nam 
 any major attempt to <unk> the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups particularly the american medical association and perhaps from the public as well if congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care 
 the nam <unk> efforts which both the administration and the medical profession have begun to measure the effectiveness of medical <unk> and then to draft <unk> guidelines 
 advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures 
 hhs secretary sullivan estimates that as much as N N of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary 
 limiting care wo n't be easy or popular 
 to slow the rise in total spending it will be necessary to reduce <unk> use of services the nam warns in a policy statement 
 this will require us to define and <unk> what is necessary or appropriate care 
 this involves <unk> and it cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider <unk> of what is necessary 
 the <unk> also <unk> treatment guidelines 
 in addition it 's <unk> with an approach that would impose <unk> <unk> or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way to slow health-care spending

 georgia-pacific corp. 's unsolicited $ N billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp. was hailed by wall street despite a cool reception by the target company 
 william r. <unk> nekoosa 's chairman chief executive officer and president characterized the $ <unk> bid as <unk> and said nekoosa 's board would consider the offer in due course 
 t. marshall hahn jr. georgia-pacific 's chairman and chief executive said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable 
 he added that he had spoken with mr. <unk> whom he referred to as a friend by telephone monday evening 
 i 'm hopeful that we 'll have further discussions mr. hahn said 
 on wall street takeover stock traders bid nekoosa 's stock well above the georgia-pacific bid assuming that nekoosa 's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to georgia-pacific at a higher price as much as $ N a share according to some estimates 
 yesterday nekoosa common closed in composite new york stock exchange trading at $ N up $ N on volume of almost N million shares 
 georgia-pacific closed down $ N at $ N in big board trading 
 takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray georgia-pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed namely industrial companies can continue bidding for one another but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing 
 the way the world is shaping up the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception said one trader 
 for the paper industry specifically most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of <unk> takeovers possibly involving such companies as union camp corp. federal <unk> co. and mead corp 
 the analysts argued that georgia-pacific 's offer the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry ends the <unk> <unk> on hostile bids and will push <unk> to look closely at the industry 's several attractive takeover candidates 
 consolidation has been long overdue 
 it was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening 
 the georgia-pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape said gary <unk> of oppenheimer & co 
 added mark rogers of prudential-bache securities inc. it 's much easier to be second 
 a georgia-pacific acquisition of nekoosa would create the largest u.s. forest-products company 
 based on N sales georgia-pacific ranked third at $ N billion behind weyerhaeuser co. at $ N billion and international paper co. at $ N billion 
 nekoosa ranked <unk> with sales of $ N billion 
 the combined company would have had N sales of $ N billion 
 but such a combination also presents great risks 
 at a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive adding capacity and debt could squeeze georgia-pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects 
 moreover any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt georgia-pacific because two of nekoosa 's major product lines <unk> which is used to make shipping boxes and market pulp are exported in large quantities 
 nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be said rod young vice president of resource information systems inc. a <unk> mass. <unk> firm 
 depending on how far down you go it may be difficult to pay off that debt 
 one person familiar with georgia-pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ N billion 
 it also could be a drag on georgia-pacific earnings because the roughly $ N billion in goodwill the amount by which the bid exceeds nekoosa 's book value of $ N billion will have to be <unk> from earnings over a period of decades 
 georgia-pacific 's mr. hahn said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways 
 the two companies each produce market pulp <unk> and white paper 
 that means goods could be manufactured closer to customers saving shipping costs he said 
 moreover production runs would be longer cutting <unk> from adjusting machinery between production cycles 
 and georgia-pacific could save money in selling pulp because the company uses its own sales organization while nekoosa employs <unk> agents 
 mr. hahn said georgia-pacific has accounted in its strategy for a significant downturn in the pulp and paper industry an event that he said would temporarily <unk> earnings 
 but he said that even under those conditions the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger 
 the fit is so good we see this as a time of opportunity he said 
 georgia-pacific which has suspended its <unk> program would finance the acquisition with all bank debt provided by banks led by bankamerica corp 
 georgia-pacific owns N nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $ N million worth 
 u.s. clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition 
 for nekoosa defense options may be undercut somewhat by the <unk> state of the junk-bond market which limits how much value the target could reach in a <unk> recapitalization 
 the company 's chairman mr. <unk> and a group of advisers met at the offices of <unk> lipton rosen & katz a law firm specializing in takeover defense 
 nekoosa also is being advised by goldman sachs & co 
 georgia-pacific 's advisers are <unk> <unk> & co. which stands to receive a $ N million fee if the takeover succeeds and the law firm of <unk> & sterling 
 people familiar with nekoosa said its board is n't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid 
 the board has N business days to respond 
 in addition to the usual array of defenses including a so-called poison pill and a <unk> board nekoosa has another takeover defense a maine state law barring hostile bidders from <unk> acquired businesses for five years 
 nekoosa is incorporated in maine 
 georgia-pacific has filed a lawsuit in federal court in maine challenging the poison pill and the maine merger law 
 nekoosa 's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to <unk> it but georgia-pacific is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take N to N days and would n't affect the provisions of the maine law 
 among companies mentioned by analysts as possible <unk> for nekoosa are international paper weyerhaeuser canadian pacific ltd. and macmillan <unk> ltd 
 i 'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper said <unk> <unk> an analyst with first manhattan co 
 international paper and weyerhaeuser declined to comment

 this is a one-time event said lawrence ross of painewebber inc. referring to the georgia-pacific bid 
 but many analysts believe that given the <unk> of paper companies ' cash flows as well as the <unk> consolidation of the paper industry in europe there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for u.s. companies within the next several months 
 the buyers these analysts added could be either foreign or other u.s. concerns 
 the georgia-pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation in the paper industry said mark <unk> of shearson lehman hutton inc

 the campaign a <unk> celebration of the <unk> anniversary of the bill of rights does n't mention cigarettes or smoking cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since N

 philip morris which became the u.s. 's largest food company last year with its $ N billion acquisition of kraft inc. seems determined to <unk> beyond its roots in <unk> country 
 the company 's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low although its array of brands including maxwell house coffee <unk> <unk> <unk> and miller beer blanket supermarket shelves 
 the company is expected to spend about $ N million a year on its two-year corporate campaign created by wpp group 's ogilvy & mather unit in new york 
 the initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows 
 philip morris hopes that by taking its bill of rights theme to the <unk> in addition to publications it will reach the <unk> possible audience 
 until now its corporate ads mainly promoting its <unk> of the arts have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines 
 most people whether in toledo tucson or <unk> have n't got a clue who we are says guy l. smith philip morris 's vice president of corporate affairs 
 if they think well of the company through our support of the bill of rights it follows they 'll think well of our products 
 mr. smith says the bill of rights commercial which <unk> the themes of liberty and freedom of expression is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers 
 although philip morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with <unk> arguments this has nothing to do with cigarettes nor will it ever the spokesman says 
 but some <unk> activists disagree <unk> anger at what they see as the company 's attempt to purchase <unk> by association 
 i 'm <unk> because this company is portraying itself at the heart of american culture and political freedom and in fact it 's a killer says michael <unk> former chairman of the federal trade commission and a <unk> critic 
 it should be treated like the <unk> drug mafia not the founding <unk> 
 mr. <unk> adds that the new commercial <unk> perfectly with major aspects of philip morris 's political strategy 
 these include trying to protect its print advertising by <unk> the first amendment and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a <unk> of civil rights 
 the commercial features among others the voice of martin <unk> king jr. the <unk> civil rights leader

 technology stocks <unk> the brunt of the otc market 's recent sell-off and traders say it 's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around 
 but they caution conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength 
 they are always the first to be sold when people are taking profits because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks said robin west director of research for <unk> <unk> 's <unk> division which specializes in emerging growth stocks 
 the technology group includes many of the otc market 's biggest stocks which dominate the <unk> nasdaq composite index 
 analysts say rallies in the group historically have lifted the market while weakness in the sector often sank <unk> share prices broadly 
 but increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its <unk> and swings 
 the stocks have been <unk> repeatedly by inventory <unk> and disappointing earnings as the industry <unk> and <unk> 
 some even claim the group has become a lagging not leading indicator 
 the technology sector of the dow jones equity market index has risen only about N N this year while the nasdaq composite index has gained N N 
 while the composite index lost less than a third of its <unk> gains in the market 's recent decline the technology group 's gains were more than <unk> 
 the otc technology sector is far from a <unk> unit

 microsoft is up more than N N this year while intel is up more than N N 
 the technology group is also split between large companies and small with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip issues in the institutional marketplace while the smaller stocks <unk> on their individual merits or <unk> analysts say 
 the volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading according to hambrecht & quist 's technology stock indexes 
 the brokerage firm tracks technology stocks with its technology index which <unk> only N N in the first nine months of this year

 on the other hand mr. <unk> noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted yesterday 
 shearson lehman hutton gave small investors some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle <unk> program trades for its accounts

 a permanent smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline routes won approval from the house which separately sent to president bush a nearly $ N billion fiscal N bill including the first construction funds for the space station 
 the smoking prohibition remains attached to a $ N billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in congress 
 but yesterday 's action put to rest any <unk> resistance from tobacco interests 
 faced with inevitable defeat the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban which covers all but a fraction of N N of daily flights in the u.s. 
 the sole exceptions are an estimated N flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in hawaii and alaska 
 assuming final enactment this month the prohibition will take effect N days later or in early february 
 on a N roll call the house adopted the underlying transportation measure 
 but the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs 
 the additional spending <unk> the measure more than $ N billion above its prescribed budget ceiling and the house appropriations committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today 
 the separate $ N billion bill sent to the white house had budget difficulties too but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in congress and the administration itself 
 no single bill this year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and apart from the space station the measure <unk> far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market 
 the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal housing administration is increased to $ N during fiscal N 
 and in anticipation of increased lending the cap on fha loan guarantees would rise to approximately $ N billion 
 separately the bill gives authority to the department of housing and urban development to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the government under the so-called section N <unk> program for <unk> families 
 this provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients ' portfolios 
 but the promise of at least $ N million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between hud secretary jack kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere 
 the estimated $ N billion for the space station would be double last year 's level and total appropriations for the national aeronautics and space administration would grow N N to nearly $ N billion 
 a string of costly projects including the <unk> national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite would continue to be developed within these limits 
 and while imposing a statutory cap of $ N billion on future spending the bill would give nasa $ N million for the start-up of the <unk> mission a successor to the <unk> space probe 
 separately the national science foundation is promised a N N increase to bring its appropriations to $ N billion 
 and while pursuing these initiatives congress and the white house are squeezed too by steady increases $ N million in veteran 's medical care 
 the result is that all sides resort to <unk> of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal N 
 senior members of the house budget committee are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills yet admit that much of the <unk> now stems from the fiscal <unk> associated with their own summit agreement with the white house this past spring 
 it 's hard to get the administration 's attention on anything said rep. bill <unk> r. minn. because the whole agreement was built on <unk> 
 among the subsidies continued in the transportation bill is $ N million to maintain commercial air service for an estimated N communities often in rural areas 
 senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd d. <unk> strongly resisted deeper cuts sought by the house 
 but at a time when the white house wants to kill the entire program republicans have been among its leading <unk> 
 sen. pete <unk> r. n.m. the ranking republican on the senate budget committee used his influence to preserve more than $ N in subsidies for air service to <unk> fe n.m. and more than $ N million would go for service to eight communities in the western nebraska district of gop rep. virginia smith on the house appropriations committee 
 <unk> express an independent airline serving much of nebraska estimates that nearly N N of its revenues come from the subsidies that in some cases exceed the cost of a ticket 
 for example a passenger can fly from <unk> neb. to denver for as little as $ N to $ N according to prices quoted by the company 
 but given the few number of users the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $ N according to house and senate appropriations committees 
 the house action yesterday came as the senate remained mired in difficulties over a $ N billion measure covering the budgets for the state commerce and justice departments in fiscal N 
 the compromise bill passed the house last week but has now provoked <unk> fights with the senate foreign relations committee which <unk> protects its prerogatives over operations at the state department 
 the same <unk> can breed confusion however in the absence of any authorization bill this year 
 house and senate <unk> sought to establish a nov. N deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed 
 but on a N roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after foreign relations chairman <unk> <unk> d. <unk> complained that it was an <unk> on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades 
 coda energy inc. said it arranged a $ N million credit facility with ncnb texas national bank a unit of ncnb corp. of charlotte n.c

 santa fe pacific was the kind of story wall street loved 
 since the value of its assets was n't known analysts were free to pick a number 
 in one of many <unk> scenarios bear stearns 's gary <unk> wrote in march that its real estate alone had a value of $ N billion 
 throw in its railroad minerals pipeline and oil assets he and others argued and the chicago-based conglomerate should be worth N a share 
 and why should holders expect to realize that presumed worth 
 that was another reason the street loved santa fe 
 with real estate experts olympia & york and samuel <unk> 's itel owning close to N N of santa fe 's stock management was under pressure in a favored phrase of wall street to quickly maximize values 
 but value it turns out is only what a buyer will pay 
 and with the company 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate the values suddenly look poorer 
 santa fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a N N interest in its real estate unit to the california public employees retirement system for roughly $ N million 
 since the real estate unit also includes debt the <unk> value of the real estate itself is close to $ N billion 
 the implied current net asset value of N per share is well below the N level that the street believed painewebber says 
 the upside was in the <unk> real estate which is no longer an <unk> 
 so what is santa fe worth 
 if the railroad is valued on a private market basis at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of cnw it would have a value of $ N billion 
 a compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash including its N N stake in its publicly traded pipeline at $ N billion 
 santa fe also has $ N billion in debt 
 in addition its railroad lost a $ N million antitrust suit which is on appeal and which analysts say could be settled for one-third that amount 
 that <unk> out to about $ N a share for the company on a private market basis 
 but santa fe currently trading at N N is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets because the tax against it would be onerous 
 its plan instead is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets 
 robert d. <unk> santa fe 's chairman argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole 
 but it is n't clear why that should be so 
 the spinoff argument after all <unk> the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders 
 and real estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership 
 salomon brothers says we believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount after the realty unit is spun off 
 and what about the cost and risk of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values 
 some analysts remain bullish 
 mr. <unk> of bear stearns says he is <unk> the worth of the company 's assets and in the meantime is sticking to his buy recommendation on the belief that he will find values of N a share 
 he adds if for any reason i do n't have the values then i wo n't recommend it 
 first boston 's <unk> anne <unk> values santa fe at N down from her earlier estimate of N 
 her recent report <unk> the stock as a hold 
 but it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door 
 <unk> from the report the stock 's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively <unk> investment at current prices especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side 
 chairman <unk> says the california pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have been offered to others 
 in other words the real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests 
 since most of the unit 's real estate is in california the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held <unk> to <unk> boards 
 and as mr. <unk> says with itel and <unk> on the unit 's board the real estate will be run by a very unusual group to say the least 
 it is possible then that santa fe 's real estate even in a state <unk> by earthquakes could one day fetch a king 's <unk> 
 but as drexel analyst linda dunn notes its properties will be developed over N to N years 
 so despite wall street 's <unk> talk of quickly <unk> values holders could be in for a long wait

 federal and state thrift <unk> said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of lincoln savings & loan association and a california regulator described an attempted <unk> by deputies of chief federal regulator danny wall 
 in a <unk> day of hearings before the house banking committee the <unk> described finding <unk> documents a <unk> panamanian subsidiary millions of dollars <unk> into a swiss bank and a <unk> attitude by mr. wall 's deputies one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator 
 a california official also said he sent the federal bureau of investigation a <unk> of documents relating to a previously reported $ N contribution from lincoln 's parent <unk> by sen. alan cranston d. calif 
 federal examiner alex <unk> said lincoln 's operations amounted to <unk> debt to provide a <unk> life style for its owners 
 another federal examiner john <unk> said lincoln 's principal owner charles keating jr. and his family drew off at least $ N million from the thrift in salaries bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the N N years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year 
 lincoln 's collapse may cost taxpayers as much as $ N billion according to estimates making it the most expensive thrift failure in history 
 i think there 's overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity said mr. <unk> who participated last year in an examination of the irvine calif. thrift 
 he said the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by mr. keating and others although he did n't <unk> any specific violation 
 richard <unk> a california state official who last year examined lincoln 's parent american continental corp. said he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed 
 it sure <unk> like it he said 
 he said N N of the loans he <unk> were dead meat on the day they were made 
 the state examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write-downs of lincoln 's bad loans that he immediately grew <unk>

 leonard <unk> a washington attorney for lincoln 's parent corporation said in an interview we deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers

 we simply do n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation 
 mr. wall 's deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the banking committee 's hearings which committee chairman henry gonzalez d. texas has used as a forum to <unk> mr. wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job 
 a couple of things mr. <unk> said were at least misleading said kevin o'connell one of the washington regulators responsible for the handling of lincoln 
 in an interview he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss and forced lincoln to make an $ N million downward adjustment on another 
 our response to the <unk> would simply be look what happened another washington official alvin <unk> said in an interview 
 federal officials seized the association in april a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy-law proceedings 
 the government later brought a $ N billion fraud suit against mr. keating and others 
 rep. gonzalez has complained that regulators waited far too long however ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place lincoln into <unk> two years before it failed 
 he took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence rep. gonzalez said 
 state thrift examiner eugene <unk> said he found the chief federal examiner steve scott to be totally <unk> in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions 
 frankly it was like he worked for the lincoln public-relations department mr. <unk> testified 
 and david <unk> a federal examiner who worked under mr. scott said he found his chief oddly upbeat about lincoln 
 asked to comment a spokesman for mr. scott said mr. scott has spoken to his attorney who has advised him not to talk to anybody 
 mr. <unk> said that a day or two before lincoln 's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings he and other <unk> saw a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the document destruction center 
 we observed at least two large plastic bags of <unk> paper loaded into this truck 
 mr. <unk> said the paper had been donated to a charitable organization that sells it for recycling 
 they <unk> it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and <unk> 
 mr. <unk> said his <unk> were aroused by several foreign investments by lincoln including $ N million paid to credit suisse of switzerland an $ N million interest in saudi european bank in paris a $ N million investment in a <unk> trading company and a recently discovered holding in a <unk> company <unk> holdings 
 mr. <unk> said i can see why an s&l examiner would regard these as unusual activities but said the overseas investments essentially broke even for the s&l 
 ltv steel co. is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of N N following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products 
 the big questions are whether the increase effective jan. N N will stick and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit 
 it is widely expected that they will 
 the increase is on the base price which is already being discounted by virtually all steel producers 
 but ltv 's move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices 
 major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $ N a ton compared with a peak price of $ N a ton in N 
 <unk> companies are receiving even less per ton 
 ltv 's planned increase which was announced in an oct. N memo to district managers does n't affect <unk> steel or <unk> plate 
 ltv confirmed the <unk> plan saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities 
 a spokesman for ltv steel which is a unit of dallas-based ltv corp. noted that steel prices adjusted for inflation increased only N N between N and the fourth quarter of N while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much 
 at the same time steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive 
 but analysts say the company is also trying to prevent further price drops 
 moreover they note that ltv may be trying to send a signal to major customers such as chrysler corp. and <unk> corp. that steelmakers need more money 
 both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with ltv and others 
 they ltv may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices said peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc 
 mr. marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early N and then reverse themselves 
 he is n't convinced though that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong 
 and while customers such as steel service centers are continuing to reduce inventories through the fourth quarter they eventually will begin <unk> up again he notes 
 it wo n't be clear for months whether the price increase will stick 
 steelmakers announced a round of <unk> increases last year but began offering sizable discounts over the summer 
 in fact ltv was the first steelmaker to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel 
 in composite new york stock exchange trading yesterday ltv common shares fell N cents to close at $ N

 senate leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government 's debt limit but the major <unk> block remains president bush 's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate 
 democrats want the tax provision to be a separate bill subject to the usual procedural obstacles 
 republicans meanwhile want to try to protect the measure by combining it with two politically popular issues that democrats could find hard to block 
 the talks between senate majority leader george mitchell of maine and his gop counterpart sen. robert dole of kansas are expected to resume today 
 last night after meeting with mr. bush and administration officials at the white house mr. dole proposed streamlining the fiscal N deficit-reduction bill now stalled in a house-senate conference committee and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments 
 under this plan two provisions currently in the house version of the <unk> bill repeal of both the <unk> insurance program and a controversial N tax provision intended to counter discrimination in <unk> plans would be made into a separate bill 
 republicans would try to <unk> a capital-gains provision to that legislation hoping the political popularity of its other two parts would <unk> democrats from blocking it 
 democrats want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill 
 sen. mitchell is confident he has sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions 
 both plans would drop child-care provisions from the house version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill 
 while that could make it vulnerable to a veto by mr. bush democrats argue that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year 's congressional elections 
 senate democrats are to meet today to consider the gop proposal 
 yesterday mr. dole seemed <unk> of the bush administration 's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of democratic procedural hurdles 
 pushing the issue on legislation needed to avoid default by the federal government he told reporters does n't seem to be very good strategy to me

 the company also retained attorney martin p. <unk> a director of the company and former head of the <unk> publishing group as an adviser 
 net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ N million down from $ N million last year 
 the company attributed the decrease in part to the exclusion of the company 's british sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and in part to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts

 under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders the new york stock exchange is considering <unk> a collar on program trading that it abandoned last year according to people familiar with the big board 
 the exchange also may step up its disclosure of firms engaged in program trading these people said 
 big board officials would n't comment publicly 
 but in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a national problem big board chairman john j. phelan jr. said we are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term to help the situation 
 mr. phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being <unk> to <unk> swings caused by program trades 
 he said he is very surprised by the furor over program trading and the exchange 's role in it that has <unk> in recent days 
 mr. phelan said that the big board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue but that banning <unk> trading strategies entirely as some investors want would be like taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse 
 the exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that 
 big board officials have been under <unk> from both investors and the exchange 's own floor traders since the dow jones industrial average 's 190-point tumble on oct. N 
 mr. phelan has n't been making public remarks in recent days and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue 
 what the big board is considering is <unk> a collar on program trading when the market moves significantly 
 early last year after a <unk> one-day drop in the dow the big board instituted the collar which banned program trading through the big board 's computers whenever the dow moved N points up or down in a day 
 it did n't work 
 the collar was <unk> on a number of occasions meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to <unk> the collar and use the big board 's electronic trading system mr. phelan said 
 that was when the exchange took a new <unk> by publishing monthly statistics listing the top N program trading firms 
 exchange officials emphasized that the big board is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading 
 people familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it 
 meanwhile another big wall street brokerage firm joined others that have been pulling back from program trading 
 american express co. 's shearson lehman hutton inc. unit said it <unk> all index-arbitrage program trading for client accounts 
 in stock-index arbitrage traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets 
 shearson which in september was the <unk> program trader on the big board had already suspended stock-index arbitrage for its own account 
 also cs first boston inc. 's first boston corp. unit the <unk> program trader in september is preparing a response to the program-trading outcry officials of the firm said 
 first boston is one of the few major wall street firms that have n't pulled back from program trading in recent days 
 mr. phelan is an <unk> diplomat who normally appears to be <unk> in control of the big board 's <unk> 
 but he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading 
 mr. phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists who make markets in individual stocks and from many companies that have shares listed on the big board 
 mr. phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just how the world is 
 if bringing the message is a crime i 'm guilty of it 
 but he said this does n't mean he is satisfied with the market 's big swings 
 we 're trying to take care of a <unk> of a lot of constituents mr. phelan said 
 each one has a different agenda 
 for example in a special meeting monday with mr. phelan senior officials of some of the big board 's N stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests 
 we are looking for representation we have n't had a specialist said 
 we 've had <unk> 
 after another session mr. phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as morgan stanley & co. goldman sachs & co. painewebber group inc. and first boston all of which have engaged in program trading an executive of a top brokerage firm said clearly the firms want the exchange to take leadership 
 many specialist firms <unk> the big board 's new basket product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the standard & poor 's 500-stock index in one shot 
 ultimately the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise 
 his phelan 's own interests are in building an electronic marketplace said a market maker 
 the basket product while it has got off to a slow start is being supported by some big brokerage firms another member of mr. phelan 's <unk> constituency 
 mr. phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the big board is serious about curbing volatility especially as the exchange clearly <unk> its role as the home for $ N billion in stock-index funds which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the standard & poor 's N and which sometimes employ program trading 
 the big board wants to keep such index funds from <unk> to overseas markets but only as long as it handles it <unk> mr. phelan said 
 despite what some investors are suggesting the big board is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures exchange officials said 
 most revisions it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during <unk> periods said officials working with the exchange 
 computers have made trading more rapid but that can be fixed with some <unk> 
 i think if you can speed things up you can slow them down mr. phelan said

 while volatility wo n't go away he said volatility is greater than program trading 
 what i 'm trying to say to people is it 's proper to worry about program trading but it 's only a piece of the business

 indeed mr. phelan said that if stock-market volatility <unk> the u.s. may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital 
 japan 's markets are more stable he said

 for now however mr. phelan said i refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is <unk> 
 we have a major problem and that problem is volatility

 gasb rules still apply for other government units 
 after the gasb was founded in N N years after the fasb the government-owned entities were supposed to follow fasb rules unless the gasb <unk> them 
 the gasb had told governments they did n't have to follow fasb rules on depreciation making it difficult for <unk> agencies to compare private and state-owned schools which compete in the public bond market 
 the foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next jan. N and makes the financial results of the hospitals colleges and schools easier to compare with <unk> businesses 
 but it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under fasb rules and those still under gasb rules 
 managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and <unk> <unk> with <unk> businesses is n't always as high a priority a foundation spokesman said

 hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor expecting to pay about N million yen for the project

 in late may <unk> & lewis announced a plan to cut prices N N to N N and eliminate what it called a standard <unk> practice of negotiating individual deals with customers 
 the consumer agency also disputed <unk> & lewis 's continuing strategy of advertising new lower prices when <unk> there have n't been price reductions since june N 
 richard d. lewis president of the <unk> chain defended the company 's pricing campaign saying it did n't use the misleading expression reduced from original prices 
 mr. lewis said the company marked price <unk> and advertised at its lowest possible prices for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion 
 mr. lewis said the company gave the consumer affairs department volumes of documents to <unk> its statements and made every effort to comply with all the agency 's policies

 wary investors have been running for the stock market 's equivalent of bomb shelters buying shares of <unk> and utility companies 
 those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs 
 on friday when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the new york stock exchange five were <unk> issues and another four were utilities 
 on monday when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs six were utilities or <unk> 
 at first <unk> gold and utilities seem strange <unk> 
 after all gold prices usually soar when inflation is high 
 utility stocks on the other hand <unk> on <unk> because the fat dividends utilities pay look more attractive when prices are falling or rising slowly 
 but the two groups have something very important in common they are both <unk> for scared money stocks for people who hate stocks 
 it 's as if investors the past few days are betting that something is going to go wrong even if they do n't know what 
 if the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on firmer footing these stocks might well fall back 
 indeed that happened to some extent yesterday as industrial stocks rebounded partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry 
 still a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares 
 the primary <unk> thing is that people are frightened says martin <unk> a new york money manager 
 the aftershocks of oct. N when the dow jones industrial average dropped N points are still <unk> 
 certainly the oct. N sell-off did n't settle any <unk> 
 beyond that money managers and analysts see other problems

 takeover fever has cooled removing a major horse from the market 's <unk> 
 britain 's unsettled political scene also worries some investors 
 the gyrations in the british government add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a <unk> stock market says john hoffman assistant director of research at smith barney harris upham & co 
 one of the three major markets in the world is getting <unk> up pretty bad 
 if the fed does not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term interest rates over the next N days the market 's going to <unk> says larry <unk> a market analyst with prudential-bache securities 
 with this sort of sentiment common it 's natural for investors to seek out defensive investments 
 utilities are a classic example even in recessions people continue to use electric power water and gas at a fairly steady rate 
 such defensive issues as food tobacco and drug stocks have been in favor for some time 
 but many of these stocks have now become expensive 
 mr. <unk> points to coca-cola co. and pepsico inc. as examples they 're selling for N to N times estimated N per-share earnings 
 gold stocks are n't cheap on this basis either with many selling for N times earnings or more 
 even utility stocks are n't all that <unk> at an average of N times earnings 
 but the two groups represent a further step in <unk> 
 if gold stocks and utilities continue to lead it may signal that the market is in for rough times 
 that 's just what joseph <unk> expects 
 we are going to <unk> lower says the flamboyant market <unk> who had a huge following a few years back 
 anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible 
 you do n't want to own anything long except gold stocks 
 one reason for his <unk> is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows 
 last friday N stocks on the big board hit new 12-month lows 
 but by mr. <unk> 's count N issues were within one point of such lows 
 robert <unk> a veteran new york money manager and president of <unk> securities has money in both gold and utility issues 
 i think we could very well have an economic slowdown beginning very soon if not already he says 
 mr. <unk> does n't expect an actual recession 
 but he does expect a <unk> <unk> of an economy with very slow growth maybe one quarter of no growth at all 
 in such a climate utility stocks look good to him 
 he favors <unk> group inc. florida progress corp. <unk> energy inc. wisconsin energy corp. and dominion resources inc 
 the appeal of gold issues mr. <unk> says is that they 're a counter group 
 you go into them because they move counter to the general market 
 he adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were ready for a bounce 
 his <unk> are american <unk> resources corp. echo bay mines ltd. and <unk> <unk> mines corp 
 nevertheless mr. <unk> <unk> that you do n't buy gold stocks based on powerful fundamentals 
 in addition to having high price-earnings ratios most pay <unk> dividends if any 
 the earning power of gold mining companies is restricted unless the gold price <unk> up over $ N an ounce he says 
 <unk> cohen an investment strategist for drexel burnham lambert also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold 
 my outlook is for a decline of about N N in corporate profits in N she says 
 but a bunch of utilities should post profit increases 
 among utilities drexel currently favors <unk> corp. and general public utilities corp 
 as for gold she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak as it has been lately 
 among gold stocks drexel likes battle mountain gold co. <unk> gold co. and freeport-mcmoran gold co 
 it never <unk> to <unk> me how the business world continues to <unk> the world 's environmental problems is science or private gain driving ozone policy by george <unk> business world oct. N 
 to suggest that a N N drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and <unk> 
 consider the fact that a mere N N drop in ozone would increase birth defects and <unk> by allowing solar radiation to alter the dna structure 
 even a small reduction is <unk> and to suggest otherwise is <unk> and <unk> 
 the reason environmentalists do n't mind seeing new crises arise is because there are new crises 
 crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were N years ago 
 if you are doubtful consider for a moment that the <unk> <unk> <unk> in northern new jersey which supply the <unk> area with drinking water are <unk> with toxic <unk> 
 this is a fact and not the product of some environmental <unk> or a group 's <unk> to create a market

 mark t. <unk> jersey city n.j 
 mr. <unk> 's column was right on the money but i wish it could have gone one step further 
 as an employee of a major <unk> and <unk> manufacturer i have been heavily involved in dealing with the political <unk> of the <unk> theory named after the researchers who found in N that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere and the montreal protocol 
 an important part of my effort has been to understand the science so i can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design 
 in my research i have found a paper by joseph <unk> of the national cancer institute and several colleagues reporting an <unk> decrease in uv-b radiation at eight u.s. measurement sites 
 our concern for the ozone layer of course grows out of the potential for increasing uv-b radiation which could damage <unk> and <unk> 
 the last of the measurements reported was in N but recent conversations with mr. <unk> indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend 
 i understand but have n't yet <unk> that there are studies by <unk> russians and the max <unk> institute that show either <unk> or declining uv-b at the surface 
 to me this calls into question the <unk> of the <unk> theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort 
 this in turn threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written 
 my questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the world resources institute with representatives of the national resource development commission the environmental protection agency friends of the earth etc. were greeted with <unk> and some <unk> comments about that report being <unk> 
 when i expressed <unk> that no one was undertaking a more current and credible uv-b study i was urged to get back to the agenda topic which was ironically a schedule for getting rid of <unk> the so-called soft cfcs that are such an important part of the <unk> <unk> scenario 
 subsequently i have learned that a private group of which du pont is a part is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the <unk> report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated <unk> measuring instruments 
 but this is almost an underground activity 
 to my knowledge no government entities including the epa are pursuing uv-b measurements 
 the topic never comes up in <unk> establishment meetings of which i have attended many 
 it seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any <unk> honest evaluation of the threat posed by cfcs 
 while recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened i intend to urge that uv-b be monitored whenever i can 
 frederick h. <unk> vice president industry and government relations white consolidated industries inc washington 
 the relationship between surface release of cfcs and global <unk> ozone loss was identified back in N 
 although like all scientific theories it had its initial opponents few experts question the connection now 
 the discovery of the ozone hole over <unk> and the results of <unk> and <unk> aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to <unk> <unk> 
 in the september issue of scientific american thomas e. <unk> distinguished member of the technical staff at at&t bell laboratories and paul j. <unk> director of the air chemistry division of the max <unk> institute for chemistry in <unk> west germany wrote it is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons particularly <unk> and <unk> are the major <unk> responsible for ozone depletion 
 mr. <unk> quotes peter teagan and <unk> the name of arthur d. little inc. to support his statement 
 however unlike messrs. <unk> and <unk> who are both <unk> in the study of atmospheric chemistry mr. teagan has no special expertise in the area 
 he is a mechanical engineer not an atmospheric <unk> 
 it is <unk> and <unk> to say that scientists needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts and that environmental groups need them to stay in business 
 solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry policy makers and the scientific community world-wide

 mr. rifenburgh told industry analysts he is moving aggressively to negotiate <unk> settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail 
 mr. rifenburgh also noted that N million shares of miniscribe common stock were traded during the past three years so there 's a tremendous amount of exposure 
 miniscribe has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income 
 miniscribe also has n't filed any financial statements for N 
 mr. rifenburgh said such statements should be ready by the end of november 
 he said he expects the company to have $ N million in sales for this year 
 he did n't say what the company expected to report for year-earlier sales which will be restated from the previously reported $ N million 
 the release of miniscribe 's new balance sheet came one day after it introduced its new line of <unk> disk drives on which it is <unk> much of its hope for survival 
 although it is not the first company to produce the <unk> drives which store information in personal computers miniscribe says it is the first with an <unk> drive the company plans to introduce a <unk> drive next year 
 analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday 's announcements <unk> mr. rifenburgh 's efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace 
 it 's a <unk> attitude said dave <unk> vice president of storage research for international data corp

 the <unk> definition of <unk> will favor virtually <unk> use of personal sensitive and intimate facts 
 traditional standards of <unk> and importance is this something the public ought to know will be replaced by a much broader test is this something the public is interested in knowing 
 and since the public has always been <unk> by <unk> and <unk> reporters and editors will strain for creative <unk> to justify the <unk> of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships activities of family members and all matters about mental and physical health 
 similarly <unk> images will be more vivid <unk> and sometimes <unk>

 bankers trust new york corp. won permission from the federal reserve board to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary 
 the seemingly mundane action which was opposed by the securities industry association a trade group has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities 
 the fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite 
 several other banks have similar applications pending 
 over the past two years the fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole <unk> of securities firms 
 securities firms have challenged those fed approvals saying they violate federal laws <unk> the banking and securities businesses 
 however the fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than N N of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks such as dealing in u.s. treasurys 
 for some banks that N N ceiling created problems 
 but by allowing <unk> securities inc. to handle private <unk> the fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do 
 private <unk> involve debt and equity securities typically in denominations of $ N million that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the securities and exchange commission

 every <unk> at N a.m. 40-year-old mike sinyard <unk> cycling clothes <unk> on a bike he keeps at his morgan hill calif. office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car 
 as many as N of his employees at specialized bicycle components inc. ride with him 
 when they return to their desks at N p.m. they have <unk> N miles 
 such <unk> for cycling helped mr. sinyard build a creative company at the <unk> of its industry 
 founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen specialized spotted the appeal of <unk> bikes that go almost anywhere and began <unk> them in N 
 in the past five years the company 's sales have grown to $ N million from $ N million 
 today so-called mountain bikes account for two-thirds of the $ N billion spent annually on all <unk> in the u.s. 
 with N N of its sales coming from mountain bikes specialized is widely considered to be a market leader 
 accessories largely for mountain-bike users account for much of the rest of sales 
 but today the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever 
 one large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market specialized helped create turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 thus mr. sinyard 's company must <unk> more than ever to stay ahead of them by developing new products specifically for mountain <unk> 
 at the same time though it must become more structured to better manage its growth 
 <unk> both will be a <unk> act as challenging as riding a <unk> 
 it is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast especially when their success attracts big-time competitors 
 the big word around specialized is passion says <unk> eidsmo a former <unk> executive whom mr. sinyard recruited from citicorp to run marketing and sales 
 what i hope to bring to this is another word process 
 that 's my challenge 
 it 's mike 's challenge as well 
 mr. eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the <unk> fast-growing company under tighter control 
 we had a lot of problems mr. sinyard says 
 while the company 's sales were soaring we still had a system that was probably appropriate for $ N million to $ N million in sales 
 adds mr. eidsmo what felt good that day was done that day 
 since his <unk> in may mr. eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for citicorp such as <unk> detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends 
 we 're finally getting and it 's been very painful some understanding of what the company 's long-term horizon should begin to look like mr. eidsmo says 
 but it 's risky he says of specialized 's attempt to adopt a corporate structure 
 you do n't want to lose the magic of the company 's creative drive 
 hoping to stay ahead of the pack the company is <unk> innovation 
 at a recent trade show <unk> lined up to view a new specialized bike frame that <unk> just N pounds a pound less than the <unk> mountain-bike frame on the market

 at the trade show specialized also unveiled a revolutionary <unk> bike <unk> developed jointly by specialized and du pont co 
 made of <unk> materials the <unk> <unk> are designed like <unk> wings to <unk> N minutes off the time of a rider in a <unk> race the company claims 
 it currently costs $ N though mr. sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ N and $ N 
 he was able to slash the price of the company 's least expensive mountain bike to $ N from $ N in 
 but demands on the company 's creativity are certain to grow 
 competition is <unk> as larger companies <unk> a mountain-bike market mr. sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself 
 u.s. cycling federation official philip <unk> says mountain <unk> is growing at such a <unk> rate that a lot of companies are getting into this 
 one especially <unk> specialized market the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories which mr. eidsmo calls the future of our business 
 accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes they also offer profit margins nearly double the N N to N N or so on sales of complete cycles 
 to get a piece of the business <unk> inc. <unk> ore. introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes 
 about a month ago michelin tire corp. greenville s.c. began selling mountain-bike tires for years a specialized <unk> 
 competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too 
 <unk> bicycle corp. which accounts for <unk> of the $ N million in annual sales at its <unk> parent <unk> corp. entered the mountain-bike business in N 
 <unk> previously made only traditional road bikes but it did n't take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike says <unk> 's president dick burke 
 the segment now makes up roughly two-thirds of his company 's total sales 
 at giant bicycle inc. <unk> <unk> calif. sales have tripled since the company entered the u.s. mountain-bike business in N 
 a subsidiary of a taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $ N million giant is one example of the sudden <unk> of mr. sinyard 's <unk> market niche 
 <unk> bicycle co. chicago established joint ventures with bike companies in <unk> china and hungary to sell bikes 
 in the past year <unk> international corp. <unk> has acquired such major brands as <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 in response to the <unk> of the business mr. sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries 
 the move will cut out the cost of a <unk> and give specialized more control over marketing and sales

 we saw good retail demand by small banks individuals and institutions and that is one reason why the market advanced late in the day said sung won <unk> senior vice president and chief economist at <unk> corp. minneapolis

 the average discount rate on three-month bills was N N and the rate on six-month bills was N N 
 those rates are up from N N and N N respectively at last week 's auction 
 due to the treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at midnight tonight yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales 
 the treasury bills sold yesterday settle today rather than the standard settlement day of thursday 
 and because of the early settlement the three-month bills actually have a <unk> maturity and the six-month bills have an <unk> maturity

 the move is sure to <unk> concerns about increased japanese investment in u.s. biotechnology firms

 yesterday in national trading in the over-the-counter market gen-probe common closed at $ N a share 
 because the u.s. leads in most areas of biotechnology largely because of research investment by the u.s. government the sale is sure to increase concerns that japanese companies will buy american know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition 
 the biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors said richard <unk> president of the industrial biotechnology association 
 he added that until now the japanese have only acquired equity positions in u.s. biotechnology companies 
 they are <unk> onto developed technology he said 
 during the past five years japanese concerns have invested in several of the u.s. 's N independent biotechnology companies 
 chugai has been one of the most active japanese players in u.s. biotechnology companies it has an equity investment in genetics institute inc. cambridge mass. and a joint-venture agreement with upjohn co. <unk> mich 
 the japanese government mr. <unk> said has stated that it wants N N to N N of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products 
 it is becoming more of a horse race every day between the u.s. and japan he said adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor electronics and automobile industries japanese companies will use <unk> technology to gain trade advantages 
 mr. bologna said the sale would allow gen-probe to speed up the development of new technology and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer 
 by N when only N genetic <unk> tests of diagnostic <unk> diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the food and drug administration eight of them had been developed and sold by gen-probe 
 <unk> <unk> deputy president of chugai which spends about N N of its sales on research and development was unable to pinpoint how much money chugai would pump into gen-probe 
 we think gen-probe has technology important to people 's health he said adding we think it is important for us to have such technology 
 he and mr. bologna emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of gen-probe which will expand significantly as a result of the acquisition 
 in N chugai had net income of $ N million on revenue of $ N million 
 <unk> had a net loss of $ N million on revenue of $ N million 
 recently gen-probe received a broad u.s. patent for a technology that helps detect identify and <unk> <unk> <unk> through the targeting of a form of genetic material called <unk> <unk> 
 among other things mr. bologna said that the sale will facilitate gen-probe 's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids 
 chugai also will help gen-probe with its regulatory and marketing expertise in asia mr. bologna said 
 the tender offer for gen-probe 's shares is expected to begin next monday the company said 
 it was supposed to be a routine <unk> call 
 a <unk> soviet space officials in tokyo in july for an exhibit stopped by to see their counterparts at the national space development agency of japan 
 but after a few <unk> the soviets unexpectedly got serious 
 the soviets have a <unk> space program the guests noted 
 would n't the japanese like a piece of it 
 the visitors then listed technologies up for sale including launch services and <unk> hardware 
 we were just surprised says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's director for international affairs 
 shocked 
 that moscow with its <unk> economic machine would try to sell high technology to japan one of the world 's high-tech leaders sounds like a <unk> notion 
 but the soviet union has areas where it is n't behind japan says mikhail <unk> of the soviet ministry of foreign economic relations 
 we have obtained through the development of <unk> the soviet space program technologies you do n't see anywhere else 
 the sales pitch might n't be as <unk> as it seems 
 <unk> trade relations are <unk> these days and some japanese favor <unk> their reliance on u.s. technology in light of the <unk> <unk> <unk> when u.s. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial <unk> technology 
 and despite its image as a technology <unk> japan has a lot of weaknesses 
 it 's a world leader in semiconductors but behind the u.s. in making the computers that use those chips 
 it 's a world leader in auto manufacturing but its aviation industry is struggling and its space program is years behind the u.s. the europeans and the soviets 
 one question being <unk> in the soviet union is how to use the defense sector 's <unk> expertise in the rest of the economy 
 many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce <unk> videocassette recorders small <unk> and <unk> machinery 
 the soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science which has helped them win twice as many nobel science prizes as the japanese 
 where they lag behind the japanese is in turning the scientific <unk> into improved production 
 by contrast the japanese have proved <unk> at making use of soviet <unk> 
 kobe steel ltd. adopted soviet casting technology in N and used it for N years until it developed its own system 
 <unk> steel corp. bought a soviet <unk> patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the soviets 
 in N the soviets will take a japanese journalist into space the first japanese to go into <unk> 
 soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the u.s. japan 's principal ally 
 we have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the soviet union says a state department official 
 frankly i would n't expect the japanese to get <unk> on anybody 's technology least of all the soviets 
 under mikhail gorbachev 's perestroika the soviets have sought economic ties all over the world including new export markets 
 they believe technology is one of their best bets and some soviet officials say moscow will even consider <unk> military know-how if the price is right 
 the soviets held export <unk> that included high-tech items in new york and west germany 
 last week a soviet delegation came to japan to push more space technologies 
 japan is a major target for the soviets 
 in august representatives of <unk> japan 's largest business organization visited moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the soviet economy 
 out of the blue the soviet chamber of commerce handed over details on N technologies that the japanese might want to buy 
 these mainly involved such areas as materials advanced <unk> machines for example and medical developments derived from <unk> in space such as <unk> blood vessels 
 a main motive is hard cash 
 but while the soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from japan they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise 
 the soviet union has a lot of know-how but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy says mr. <unk> the foreign ministry official 
 the soviets are contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop technology jointly and even to market it jointly he says 
 even if the japanese find soviet technology desirable such discussions would be <unk> with political <unk> 
 still <unk> from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the soviets by a subsidiary of japan 's toshiba corp. many japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the soviets in any way 
 another hurdle concerns japan 's attempts to persuade the soviet union to <unk> its <unk> war ii control of four islands north of japan 
 so far the soviets have provided only the <unk> information about their technology and business plans 
 and what they have shown is n't impressive 
 my impression is that there is n't anything which <unk> our interest at first <unk> says an official from japan 's ministry of international trade and industry 
 peter <unk> in moscow contributed to this article 
 during its centennial year the wall street journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history 
 may N N signaled a <unk> may day for securities houses which were forced to end N years of charging fixed commissions 
 it scared brokers but most survived 
 it took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the securities and exchange commission and traders and exchanges 
 despite warnings from such leaders as former federal reserve board chairman william <unk> martin that <unk> commissions would undo the industry the sec in september N said full competition must start may <unk> N 
 the timing for change was right 
 institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades 
 and the industry was <unk> with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using <unk> gifts women and <unk> 
 within three weeks of the N end to fixed rates there were <unk> price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business with rate <unk> of N N to N N below <unk> N levels 
 ray <unk> jr. sec chairman said the <unk> and <unk> of the discounting is more than i expected 
 even a federal measure in june allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions did n't stop it 
 longer term the impact is unclear 
 the change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms 
 but there are currently more exchange members than in N with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions 
 commissions however account for a smaller share of <unk> business as takeover advisory fees have soared 
 foreign stock markets with which the u.s. is <unk> also have ended fixed commissions in recent years 
 it came in london 's big bang N deregulation and toronto 's little bang the same year 
 paris is currently <unk> out fixed commissions under its <unk> <unk> bang plan 
 president bush said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to poland to gauge how the u.s. can help the new <unk> government 's economic changes 
 mr. bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission composed of top government aides and business and labor leaders 
 the mission will visit poland from nov. N to dec. N the white house said 
 in remarks at a white house <unk> marking polish heritage month mr. bush announced that agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> commerce secretary robert mosbacher and labor secretary elizabeth dole will lead the u.s. group 
 michael <unk> chairman of the council of economic advisers also will be a member 
 in addition the white house said that charles harper chairman of <unk> inc. and john <unk> chairman of manufacturers hanover corp. will be among a group of at least N business and labor representatives in the presidential mission 
 mr. bush said the group is to focus on economic sectors where u.s. expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference 
 mr. bush has asked congress to provide more than $ N million in economic aid and food grants for poland 's new government but has been <unk> by democrats for failing to do more 
 warner communications inc. is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with irving azoff who resigned in september as head of mca inc. 's mca records unit 
 warner and mr. azoff declined comment as did mca where mr. azoff had also been discussing such a venture 
 but record industry executives familiar with the talks said mr. azoff and warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a N joint-venture company funded by warner and run by mr. azoff 
 among other things they said mr. azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label 
 the agreement is said to be similar to warner 's N partnership with record and movie producer david <unk> whose films and records are distributed by the warner bros. studio and the warner records unit 
 although mr. azoff wo n't produce films at first it is possible that he could do so later the sources said 
 like mr. <unk> 's arrangement the venture gives mr. azoff a link to the world 's largest and most successful record distributor in the u.s. alone warner has a N N share of the market about double its <unk> competitor sony corp. 's cbs records 
 for warner meanwhile it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the <unk> of the hottest trends in the music business 
 the <unk> mr. azoff a former rock <unk> roll manager is credited with turning around mca 's <unk> music division in his six years at the company 
 but mr. azoff had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his mca contract which expired in N 
 mr. azoff reportedly was <unk> and frequently <unk> with top mca management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans 
 mr. azoff also was eager to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts 
 in an interview at the time of his resignation from mca he said i 'd rather build a company than run one

 nearly <unk> of the people who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned according to the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey 
 the roper organization which conducted the survey said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it <unk> than they expected 
 it is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout 
 the fitness craze itself has gone soft the survey found 
 fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as <unk> tennis <unk> and <unk> 
 half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise 
 that 's good news for marketers of walking shoes 
 the survey also detected a bit more interest in golf a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers 
 the survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of <unk> <unk> tennis <unk> and home exercise equipment but people 's good intentions if not their actions are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy 
 for instance sales of <unk> exercise bikes <unk> <unk> and the like are expected to rise N N to about $ N billion this year according to the national sporting goods association which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s 
 but even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should 
 the first excuse is they do n't have enough time says research director thomas doyle 
 the second is they do n't have enough discipline 
 with more than N million exercise bikes sold in the past five years he adds a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> must be <unk> with them 
 still the average price of such bikes rose last year to $ N 
 mr. doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices 
 electronic <unk> are key 
 <unk> international inc. for example <unk> the <unk> electronic cycling <unk> a $ N <unk> cycle

 nancy <unk> who works in corporate payments at bank of america in san francisco may be a good prospect for such a <unk> 
 she 's trying to sell a $ N exercise bike she bought about five years ago for her <unk> 
 but rather than write off home fitness equipment she traded up ms. <unk> just paid about $ N for a <unk> <unk> bike with a <unk> <unk> showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair 
 i 'm using it a lot she says 
 i spent so much money that if i look at it and i 'm not on it i feel guilty 
 the poll points up some <unk> between what people say and what they do 
 a surprising N N of people said they exercise regularly up from N N in N 
 this <unk> up images of a nation full of trim <unk> folks and suggests <unk> potatoes are out of season 
 of course that is n't really the case 
 the <unk> may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like <unk> about their love life 
 they 're bound to <unk> 
 people say they <unk> and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year says <unk> spain research specialist for the president 's council on physical fitness and sports 
 it 's hard to know if people are responding <unk> 
 people are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything 
 while she <unk> the fact that more americans are getting up from the television to <unk> or garden she says the percentage of americans who do real exercise to build the heart is only N N to N N 
 so many people <unk> on answers about exercise the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous it must produce <unk> of large muscle groups must achieve N N of maximum <unk> capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of N minutes 
 one of the council 's goals set in N was to see more than N N of adults under N years of age getting vigorous exercise by N 
 that target has been revised to N N by the year N 
 but even that goal may prove optimistic 
 of N activities the journal survey found that N including <unk> skiing and <unk> are being done by fewer americans today than eight years ago 
 time pressures and the <unk> of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline 
 only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s and only slightly 
 <unk> <unk> a california lawyer gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf finding it more social and <unk>

 feeling they should devote more time to their families or their jobs many <unk> are <unk> their <unk> workout 
 even so the association of quality clubs a <unk> trade group in boston says membership revenues will rise about N N this year from last year 's $ N billion

 perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered american institution 
 the survey reported the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to just N N from N N in N 
 the american bowling congress claims a higher percentage of the public <unk> regularly but concedes its membership has declined this decade 
 to find out why the group recently commissioned a study of the past N years of <unk> research 
 three reasons were <unk> a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling <unk> bowling centers and <unk> with bowling itself 
 people who start bowling expecting it to be a <unk> exercise have been generally disappointed the report said

 the favorite remains fernando <unk> de <unk> a 40-year-old former governor of the state of <unk> 
 he came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls probably less because of his vague program to build a new brazil than because of his good looks the open backing of the powerful <unk> <unk> television network and his reputation as a hunter of <unk> or <unk> and <unk> civil <unk>

 still massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow <unk> on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of N N to N N a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper 
 about $ N billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an <unk> of inflation and deficits for the government 
 by some estimates brazil 's internal debt or combined public deficit could reach N N of its $ N billion gross domestic product 
 much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating

 economists businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic <unk> program including reduced state spending focusing spending on vital areas such as education health and welfare turning state companies private <unk> the tax system raising public service rates to match costs and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the <unk> 
 analysts also say it 's inevitable that brazil will seek to <unk> its $ N billion foreign debt on which it suspended interest payments last month 
 analysts say however that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its <unk> effects for instance by subsidizing <unk> food items 
 about N N of brazil 's voters are believed to live near the poverty level

 if the legislature does n't repeal the law due for revision in N mr. jones says humana may move its insurance operations including N jobs in louisville to another state 
 the company complains that it paid $ N million to <unk> hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members 
 but humana says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped 
 mr. conn charges that humana 's own actions undermine its argument 
 when a hospital in lexington installed a <unk> last year demand for a similar <unk> <unk> machine at a humana hospital in louisville fell N N 
 the humana hospital responded by <unk> up prices to make up for lost revenue mr. conn says and now charges as much as $ N for the procedure which costs only about $ N in lexington

 nrm energy co. said it filed materials with the securities and exchange commission calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited partnership 
 the partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding 
 nrm suspended its common distribution in june N and the distribution on its $ N cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in september 
 however unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ N million a year hurting nrm 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital nrm said 
 in following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year nrm also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ N million a year in administrative costs from the change 
 under the plan nrm said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in edisto resources corp. for every N common units owned

 the recently revived enthusiasm among small investors for stock mutual funds has been <unk> by a jittery stock market and the <unk> over program trading 
 after hitting two-year highs this summer net sales of stock funds slowed in september according to the investment company institute a trade group 
 the sales recovery <unk> to a halt this month some analysts say 
 confidence was starting to come back because we did n't have wildly volatile days says tyler <unk> research director for <unk> <unk> <unk> & co. a boston research firm 
 now everything such as program trading and wide stock market swings that everyone had pushed back in their <unk> is just sitting right there 
 net sales of stock funds in september totaled $ N million down from $ N billion in august the institute said 
 but if reinvested dividends are excluded investors put in only $ N million more than they pulled out for the month 
 october 's numbers which wo n't be released for a month are down further mutual fund executives say 
 investors in stock funds did n't panic the weekend after mid-october 's 190-point market plunge 
 most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds 
 and some fund groups said investors actually became net buyers 
 but the stock market swings have continued 
 the recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the <unk> environment in the coming months some analysts say 
 the public is very close to having had it mr. <unk> says 
 investors pulled back from bond funds in september too 
 net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $ N billion down two-thirds from $ N billion in august 
 the major reason heavy outflows from high-risk high-yield junk bond funds 
 big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued this month 
 overall net sales of all mutual funds excluding money market funds fell to $ N billion in september from $ N billion in august the trade group said 
 small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios stemming from falling prices said jacob <unk> the institute 's chief economist 
 many small investors went for the safety of money market funds 
 assets of these and other short-term funds surged more than $ N billion in september the institute said 
 analysts say additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month 
 at fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund group money funds continue to draw the most business says michael <unk> vice president marketing 
 in october net sales of stock funds at fidelity dropped sharply mr. <unk> said 
 but he emphasized that new accounts new sales inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from september 's level 
 investor interest in stock funds has n't stalled at all mr. <unk> maintains 
 he notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a <unk> period following the friday the 13th plunge 
 if that follows through next month then it will be a different story he says 
 but mr. <unk> adds sales based on a few days ' events do n't tell you much about october 's trends 
 one trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds 
 buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record $ N billion in september up fractionally from $ N billion in august 
 <unk> managers meantime went into october with less cash on hand than they held earlier this year 
 these managers held N N of assets in cash at the end of september down from N N in august and N N in september N

 secretary of state baker we read decided to kill a speech that robert gates deputy national security adviser and a career soviet expert was going to give to a student <unk> the national <unk> security conference 
 we keep wondering what mr. gates wanted to say 
 perhaps he might have cited mr. gorbachev 's need for a stable currency free and competitive markets private property and real prices and other <unk> reforms 
 perhaps he 'd have called for a <unk> political and economic system without a dominant communist party 
 or political arrangements to alleviate the <unk> and demands of soviet ethnic minorities and republics 
 why a bob gates might even have said nor are soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant western credits 
 if mr. gates had been allowed to say these things we would now be hearing about <unk> and disarray on foreign policy 
 dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope mr. gorbachev would fail just as they were when vice president quayle voiced similar <unk> 
 it 's somehow ok for secretary baker himself however to say all the same things 
 in fact he did the quotes above are from mr. baker 's speech of two weeks ago 
 so far as we can see there is no disagreement among mr. baker mr. quayle the mr. gates we 've read or for that matter president bush 
 they all understand point one nothing the u.s. can do will make much difference in whether mr. gorbachev succeeds with perestroika 
 perhaps mr. gates would <unk> more than mr. baker the many hurdles the soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed 
 but everyone agrees that mr. gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his own system 
 they can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring western money into it 
 gatt membership will not matter to <unk> coal miners short of soap nor will a start treaty make any difference to <unk> <unk> 
 on the other hand so long as mr. gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire everyone we 've heard agrees that the u.s. can benefit by engaging him 
 if a deal can be made to cut the world 's <unk> loose from moscow why not 
 we do n't expect much good from <unk> control but <unk> talks might <unk> eastern europe 
 there 's nothing in the least <unk> in all this and it would be nice to think that washington could <unk> a reasonably sophisticated complex view 
 yet much of the political culture seems intent on <unk> the bush administration for not helping mr. gorbachev 
 so every time a bush official raises a doubt about mr. gorbachev the washington community <unk> cold war and <unk> and an administration spokesman is quickly <unk> out to <unk> mr. bush wants perestroika to succeed 
 mr. baker seems especially sensitive to the washington <unk> known as <unk> 
 its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate <unk> hands in the face of congressional criticism and <unk> <unk> when someone writes the word controversy 
 as one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the times baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be <unk> and seized by the press 
 in short the problem is not <unk> disagreement but <unk> with the prospect that <unk> might fail and its political opponents will ask who lost gorbachev 
 mr. baker may want to avoid criticism from senate majority leader george mitchell but as secretary of state his audience is the entire free world not just congress 
 in any case he 's likely to find that the more he <unk> his colleagues the more leaks will pop up all around washington a lesson once learned by henry <unk> 
 letting officials express their own <unk> can be educational 
 we note that in rome yesterday defense secretary cheney said that european euphoria over mr. gorbachev is starting to be <unk> by a recognition of the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with 
 it is in the western interest to see mr. gorbachev succeed 
 the odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you 
 the ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do 
 even if the press is ready to seize and <unk> these are not very complicated thoughts 
 surely there is someone in the administration maybe bob gates who could explain them to college students or even <unk>

 describing this and other <unk> killings sen. <unk> thurmond r. s.c recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty 
 the ultimate punishment he declared will protect the <unk> from the vicious <unk> individuals who commit these crimes 
 there 's just one problem the law that sen. thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the maryland restaurant <unk> and almost all other killings 
 most <unk> are state crimes so any federal <unk> law probably would turn out to be more <unk> than substance 
 yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking 
 senate republicans after repeatedly failing to <unk> <unk> amendments to unrelated legislation have finally gotten a <unk> <unk> bill through committee 
 the democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial <unk> of death sentencing 
 even some democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the senate that favors some kind of broad <unk> measure 
 the pending bill introduced by mr. thurmond would revive the <unk> federal <unk> laws by <unk> legal procedures required by the supreme court 
 in N the high court <unk> aside all <unk> laws federal and state alike as unconstitutional 
 but in N the court permitted <unk> of such laws if they meet certain procedural requirements 
 for instance <unk> would have to consider specific <unk> and <unk> factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death 
 since that N ruling N states have <unk> the death penalty 
 but congressional democrats have blocked the same from <unk> at the federal level with the exception of a N law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related <unk> 
 the thurmond bill would establish a federally <unk> death sentence for N crimes most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the supreme court <unk> 
 among these crimes are murder on federal land presidential assassination and <unk> 
 the thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death including murder for hire 
 separately the senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of <unk> who kill americans abroad 
 amid the <unk> of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty on top of existing state laws would deter any would-be criminals 
 for one thing it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed 
 most of the crimes incorporated in the thurmond bill are <unk> rare killing a supreme court justice for instance or deliberately causing a train <unk> that results in a death 
 in fact only N defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years according to a study by the senate judiciary committee 's democratic staff 
 the last federal execution before the supreme court 's N ruling banning the death penalty took place in N meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years 
 in that sense the whole debate is sort of a fraud argues a democratic senate staff member 
 it 's <unk> attention from serious issues like how to make <unk> fbi and customs work together on drug enforcement 
 republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the thurmond bill but they contend that is n't the point 
 many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty <unk> many people from the commission of capital crimes says sen. <unk> hatch r. utah 
 executions regardless of how frequently they occur are also proper <unk> for <unk> crimes mr. hatch argues 
 thomas boyd a senior justice department official says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last november may result in a jump in capital sentences though that has n't happened so far 
 in addition to <unk> the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals this bill has made race a major part of the <unk> debate 
 before the bill left committee sen. edward kennedy d. mass attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in <unk> shown to have <unk> out executions in a <unk> manner 
 the amendment prompted an ironic protest from mr. thurmond who complained that it would kill capital punishment 
 a large number of studies suggest that state judges and <unk> have imposed the penalty in a <unk> <unk> fashion 
 and the kennedy amendment would <unk> not only federal but state <unk> in two important ways 
 it would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing <unk> disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past 
 and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to <unk> that discrimination caused any statistical racial <unk> 
 that burden is very difficult if not impossible to meet says mr. boyd 
 how do you prove a negative 
 since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate <unk> that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing executions everywhere might come to a halt mr. boyd explains 
 at least N major studies <unk> to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty <unk> against <unk> of whites compared with blacks and against black defendants compared with white defendants 
 conservatives question the <unk> of the studies and note that the supreme court ruled in N that such research regardless of its <unk> is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence 
 the kennedy amendment would in effect <unk> around the supreme court ruling 
 lawyers would <unk> seize on the provision in their <unk> appeals says richard <unk> director of the <unk> legal defense and educational fund 's <unk> defense team 
 mr. kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year 's anti-drug legislation and it will be severely attacked on the senate floor this time around 
 but if it <unk> it could prompt other statutory changes according to the mr. <unk> 
 it might force congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial <unk> <unk> by repeat offenders who <unk> their victims perhaps 
 narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever <unk> effect it now has 
 and that in turn would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances 
 a state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of telerate inc. to block the tender offer of dow jones & co. for the N N of telerate it does n't already own

 chrysler corp. chairman lee a. <unk> said the nation 's no. N auto maker will need to close one or two of its assembly plants because of the slowdown hitting the industry 
 in an interview with the trade journal automotive news mr. <unk> declined to say which plants will close or when chrysler will make the moves 
 but he said we have too many plants in our system 
 so the older or most inefficient capacity has got to go 
 according to industry analysts chrysler plants most likely to close are the st. louis no. N facility which builds chrysler <unk> and dodge <unk> models the toledo ohio jeep plant which dates back to the early <unk> and two canadian plants that build the jeep <unk> and chrysler 's <unk> vans 
 chrysler has had to temporarily close the st. louis and toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there 
 at chrysler 's N model <unk> last month chrysler motors president robert a. <unk> said the no. N auto maker along with other u.s. manufacturers might be forced to <unk> capacity if market demand does n't improve 
 but mr. <unk> 's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants could be in jeopardy 
 general motors corp. has signaled that as many as five of its u.s. and canadian plants may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess <unk> capacity 
 the overcapacity problem has <unk> in recent years with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the u.s. 
 with companies such as honda motor co. toyota motor corp. and nissan motor co. running so-called transplant auto operations japanese auto production in the u.s. will reach one million vehicles this year 
 unless the market goes to N million units which we all know it 's not going to do we have the <unk> fact that the transplants are adding capacity mr. <unk> said last month 
 the <unk> plants eventually will have the capacity to build some N million vehicles in the u.s. and that will translate into market share that is going to have to come out of somebody he added 
 already chrysler has closed the <unk> wis. plant it acquired when it bought american motors corp. in N 
 chrysler has also launched a $ N billion cost-cutting program that will cut about N white-collar workers from the payroll in the next few months 
 revco <unk> inc. the <unk> chain that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year received a $ N million offer from a group led by texas billionaire robert bass 
 revco reacted cautiously saying the plan would add $ N million of new debt to the highly leveraged company 
 it was revco 's huge debt from its $ N billion leveraged buy-out in N that forced it to seek protection under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code 
 revco insists that the proposal is simply an expression of interest because under chapter N revco has exclusivity rights until feb. N 
 those rights prevent anyone other than revco from proposing a reorganization plan 
 also under chapter N a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders banks and other creditors 
 a financial adviser for revco bondholders david <unk> of <unk> partners had mixed reactions to the offer 
 he said he feared a revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a cheap deal and that the bass group 's offer would give them more money 
 however the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only $ N million and no equity 
 the revco bonds are high-yield high-risk junk bonds holders have $ N million in claims against revco mr. <unk> said 
 revco received the offer oct. N but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders 
 acadia partners limited partnership a fort worth texas partnership that includes the robert m. bass group made the proposal 
 mr. bass is based in fort worth 
 analysts said the nation 's second-largest <unk> chain was a valuable company despite its financial woes 
 its problem they say is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ N million debt load is keeping revco in the red 
 if bought at the right price it could still be profitable said jeffrey stein an analyst at mcdonald & co. cleveland 
 in addition revco 's N stores in N states represent a lot of real estate he said and <unk> are helping <unk> the nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs 
 last week revco 's parent company <unk> holding corp. said the company reported a loss of $ N million for the fiscal first quarter compared with a loss of $ N million in the year-earlier quarter 
 sales were $ N million up N N from the previous year 
 the company based in <unk> ohio said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 acadia partners and the bass group declined to comment 
 the partnership also includes american express co. equitable life assurance society of the u.s. and shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the offer consists of $ N million in cash and the rest in notes 
 acadia would sell up to N N of the equity in the <unk> company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares 
 revco 's chairman and chief executive officer <unk> a. sells said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer 
 he said he has not met with representatives from acadia 
 any reorganization proposal mr. sells said is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company bondholders banks and other creditors 
 revco has $ N billion in claims outstanding 
 it 's not like the board can decide by itself mr. sells said adding we 're <unk> to the bass plan 
 we just want a plan that <unk> creditors and at the end leaves a healthy revco 
 but mr. <unk> the bondholders ' adviser said revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal 
 they want to <unk> it does n't exist he said 
 mr. <unk> who met with acadia representatives on oct. N said it 's certainly a responsible offer 
 it 's not an effort to steal the company in the middle of the night 
 copper futures prices failed to extend friday 's rally 
 declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down 
 the december contract was down three cents a pound settling at $ N which was just above the day 's low of $ N 
 futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week and the losses <unk> and <unk> were greater than the advances 
 two of the major factors <unk> prices the prolonged strikes at the highland valley mine in canada and the cananea mine in mexico were finally resolved 
 also the premiums paid by the u.s. government on a purchase of copper for the u.s. mint were lower than expected and acted as a price <unk> analysts said 
 the mint purchases were at premiums about N N cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper 
 at the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound 
 all this has led to prolonged selling in futures mostly on the part of computer-guided funds 
 prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas which added to the selling 
 the reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply 
 at least one analyst noted that as production improves the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies 
 demand from japan is expected to continue strong but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year he said 
 japan normally depends heavily on the highland valley and cananea mines as well as the bougainville mine in <unk> new guinea 
 recently japan has been buying copper elsewhere 
 but as highland valley and cananea begin operating they are expected to resume their roles as japan 's suppliers 
 according to fred demler metals economist for drexel burnham lambert new york highland valley has already started operating and cananea is expected to do so soon 
 the bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year 
 it has n't been operating since may N because of attacks by native <unk> 
 a recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks 
 however traders <unk> a potential production disruption in chile and a continued drop in inventories 
 workers at two <unk> mines los <unk> and el <unk> which belong to the <unk> <unk> <unk> group will vote thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today 
 the mines produced a total of N tons of copper in N 
 according to drexel 's mr. demler the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much 
 another analyst said that if there was any concern it was that a strike could encourage other <unk> in chile 
 london metal exchange copper inventories fell N tons last week to N tons a <unk> decline 
 but that development also had little effect on traders ' sentiment 
 mr. demler said that stocks of copper in u.s. producers ' hands at the end of september were down N metric tons from august to N tons 
 outside the u.s. he said producer stocks at the end of august were N tons down N tons from the end of july 
 consumer stocks of copper in the u.s. fell to N tons at the end of september from N tons a month earlier and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the u.s. at the end of july stood at N tons down from N tons in june 
 the high point of foreigners ' copper stocks this year was N tons at the end of april according to mr. demler 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 grains and soybeans 
 the prices of most corn soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the midwest continued to rebuild <unk> that were <unk> by the N drought 
 buying by the soviets has helped to <unk> up corn prices in recent weeks but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums 
 coffee 
 futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved 
 the december contract ended with a gain of N cents a pound at N cents 
 according to one analyst prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that brazil and colombia at the <unk> summit meeting in costa rica had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the <unk> of creating a new agreement 
 the reports attributed to the colombian minister of economic development said brazil would give up N bags of its quota and colombia N bags the analyst said 
 these reports were later denied by a high brazilian official who said brazil was n't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas the analyst said 
 the colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said president bush sent to colombian president <unk> <unk> and in which president bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement 
 the minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year according to the analyst 
 precious metals 
 futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume 
 december delivery gold eased N cents an ounce to $ N 
 december silver was off N cents an ounce at $ N 
 january platinum rose N cents an ounce at $ N 
 the market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week according to one analyst 
 last week 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety he said but yesterday the market lacked such <unk> 
 there was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance he said 
 the dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling as well according to the analyst 
 <unk> corp. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its common shares for employee stock plans and other general corporate purposes 
 the forest-products concern currently has about N million shares outstanding

 when the supreme soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in may N and on <unk> cooperatives a year later some western observers assumed mikhail gorbachev had launched the soviet union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy 
 their only doubt concerned the possibility that mr. gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would <unk> and that the whole process might be reversed 
 if mr. gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market he and these western observers have good reason to fear for his future as economic <unk> within communist <unk> leads <unk> to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest 
 these fears were clearly apparent when last week secretary of state james baker blocked a speech by robert gates deputy national security adviser and soviet expert on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of mr. gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding 
 yet the soviet leader 's <unk> to <unk> on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power particularly since the last politburo <unk> on sept. N do not suggest that mr. gorbachev is on the verge of being <unk> nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika 
 indeed the soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that mr. gorbachev must proceed with economic reform 
 but is he so <unk> that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run <unk> 
 and has he truly persuaded the communist party to accept economic change of a kind that will sooner or later lead to its demise 
 an alternative and more convincing explanation confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the gorbachev program is that the new soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market 
 for example while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market 
 before becoming self-employed or setting up a cooperative workers must seek permission from the local soviet council 
 permission is far from automatic the soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions and they appear to be exercising these powers 
 private <unk> for example is allowed in N soviet republics but banned by five <unk> is allowed in seven but illegal in nine 
 the controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced 
 but that changed following a resolution from the supreme soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state 
 all independent media activity is now illegal which perhaps is not surprising but so is the manufacture of <unk> cosmetics household chemicals and sand <unk> 
 medical cooperatives among the most successful in the u.s.s.r. are banned from providing <unk> services their main source of income carrying out surgery and treating cancer patients drug <unk> and pregnant women 
 earlier this month the supreme soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives the first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold the second bans cooperatives from buying industrial and food goods from the state or other cooperatives 
 if mr. gorbachev is looking toward <unk> the productive forces of the market these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless 
 along with some other <unk> indicators these developments suggest that while mr. gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls he is <unk> on creating economic structures of a kind that would <unk> find favor with the <unk> or chicago schools of economic thought 
 mr. gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods 
 he told the congress of people 's deputies on may N we do not share this approach since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country 
 having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons and the market for fear of the social political consequences mr. gorbachev seeks a third way that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter 
 most important this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely <unk> 
 indeed mr. gorbachev 's proposals display a close conceptual <unk> to the <unk> of italian <unk> whose architects spoke specifically of a third way of having produced a historic <unk> of socialism and capitalism 
 they too promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline 
 the emergence of russian <unk> had been anticipated in journalist george urban 's introduction to a series of <unk> can the soviet system survive reform published this spring 
 communism will reach its final stage of development in a <unk> <unk> <unk> in form <unk> in content and <unk> in style that will <unk> the world with <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> concept of <unk> <unk> an organic society in which citizens were <unk> and morally unified and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation 
 this unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would <unk> workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and <unk> society 
 the key to the creation of the organic state lay in the formation of natural groups that would <unk> the role of <unk> 
 by contrast a parliamentary system based on <unk> political rights and groups was held to cause rather than resolve conflict 
 the <unk> of soviet perestroika to the <unk> social blueprint of <unk> was evident when mr. gorbachev presented his economic vision to the soviet congress 
 in doing so he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market 
 instead he proposed a <unk> economy in which there would be a <unk> division between state direction of the economy and economic management 
 the latter would be undertaken by enterprises joint stock companies and cooperatives 
 these would not function <unk> but would act together to form combines unions and associations to tackle problems and coordinate their activities 
 mr. gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the <unk> ideal than was <unk> who was never able to influence business giants such as <unk> and fiat 
 the soviet communist party has the power to shape corporate development and <unk> it into a body dependent upon it 
 to ensure the loyalty of the business sector mr. gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests probably by restricting competition 
 however mr. gorbachev must ensure that within this alliance the business sector remains subordinate to the party 
 at the same time he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed 
 it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the <unk> model attractive to both the party and labor 
 the work force provides the third arm of the alliance 
 within the alliance it is supposed to act as a <unk> force <unk> against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards under the new resolutions workers <unk> may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced 
 by providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods mr. gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party 
 at the same time the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western-style political <unk> 
 the most important development in mr. gorbachev 's policy for <unk> the opposition movement is the claim that the u.s.s.r. also <unk> from terrorism 
 an increasing number of <unk> by the soviet press to opposition groups now active in the u.s.s.r. particularly the democratic union <unk> that they show <unk> <unk> and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims 
 it is possible that in <unk> such <unk> the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism 
 mr. gorbachev would appear to see his central task however as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a <unk> system reach a <unk> 
 if he were able to construct a popular and efficient <unk> system he or his heir would be <unk> to rein in political opposition and to <unk> control in eastern europe 
 the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations mr. gorbachev is a <unk> political leader perhaps one of the greatest but in its economic prescription 
 contrary to widespread belief <unk> failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time it is doubtful whether <unk> <unk> will make soviet trains run on time or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately <unk>

 new construction contracting climbed N N in september to an annualized $ N billion with commercial industrial and <unk> contracts providing most of the increase according to <unk> dodge group 
 through the first nine months of the year the <unk> total of all new construction was $ N billion flat compared with a year earlier 
 the south was off N N after the first nine months while the north central region was up N N 
 the northeast and west regions were unchanged 
 a small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing does n't increase in response to this year 's lower mortgage rates said george a. christie vice president and chief economist of dodge the forecasting division of publisher mcgraw-hill inc 
 the seasonally adjusted dodge index reached N in september its highest level this year from N in august 
 the index uses a base of N in N 
 newly contracted residential work edged up N N in september to an annualized $ N billion largely because <unk> building rebounded from a very weak august 
 at the end of the third quarter there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates mr. christie said 
 housing has been weak all year and especially so in the past five months 
 contracting for <unk> buildings rose N N in september to an annualized $ N billion 
 commercial and industrial construction rose sharply partly because of three large projects each expected to cost more than $ N million 
 institutional building such as hospitals and schools eased in september following a surge in august 
 although the third quarter was the best so far this year for <unk> building weakness early in the year held the nine-month total to $ N billion up just N N from a year earlier 
 <unk> and utility projects also known as <unk> contracting grew N N to $ N billion in september but the nine-month total of $ N billion was down N N from a year earlier

 moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of cs first boston inc. the holding company of wall street giant first boston corp. because of first boston 's aggressive merchant banking risk in highly leveraged takeovers

 we think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected 
 our commitment to manage these businesses profitably will continue 
 first boston 's merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged campeau corp. first boston 's most lucrative client of the decade was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled 
 first boston incurred millions of dollars of losses on campeau securities it owned as well as on special securities it could n't sell 
 first boston financings for several other highly leveraged clients including ohio <unk> unraveled as the high-risk junk bond market plummeted 
 moody 's said its rating changes actions reflect cs first boston 's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures 
 it said cs first boston has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking and that a very significant portion of the firm 's profit in recent years has come from merchant <unk> business 
 moody 's believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on cs first boston 's performance the rating concern said citing continued problems from the firm 's exposures to various <unk> firms and to ohio <unk> 
 these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of cs first boston 's equity moody 's said 
 total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity

 last year 's series broadcast by general electric co. 's nbc was the <unk> series in four years instead of featuring a major east coast team against a west coast team it <unk> the los angeles <unk> against the losing oakland <unk>

 the series got off to a <unk> start oct. N with a N N rating the next night it drew N N of homes 
 then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of N days 
 some people had hoped abc 's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake

 <unk> inc. has a bigger share of the <unk> market in japan than at home 
 but the japanese have to go a long way to catch up 
 typical is one office of the ministry of international trade and industry 's machinery and information industries bureau the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry 
 personal computer <unk> are lined up on nearly every desk and <unk> copies of nikkei computer crowd magazine <unk> 
 but amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one <unk> pc 
 while american pc sales have averaged roughly N N annual growth since N and west european sales a <unk> N N japanese sales were flat for most of that time 
 japanese office workers use pcs at half the rate of their european counterparts and one-third that of the americans 
 moreover japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do 
 in the u.s. pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network 
 in japan many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't <unk> with other machines 
 the market planning and sales promotion office of nomura securities co. for example has more than N computers for its N workers a respectable ratio 
 but the machines are n't on employees ' desks they ring the <unk> of the large office 
 some machines make charts for <unk> 
 others analyze the data 
 to transfer information from one to the other employees make <unk> and enter the data <unk> 
 to <unk> charts to branch offices they use a fax machine 
 meanwhile a woman sitting next to a new fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand <unk> 
 in an efficient <unk> the same pc could perform all those tasks 
 in the u.s. more than half the pc software sold is either for <unk> or for <unk> analysis according to lotus 
 in japan those functions account for only about a third of the software market 
 machines dedicated solely to word processing which have all but disappeared in the u.s. are still more common in japan than pcs 
 in the u.s. <unk> of the office pcs are <unk> up to some sort of network 
 in japan about N N are linked 
 computers here are used for data gathering says roger j. <unk> who manages the <unk> group in <unk> & co. 's tokyo office 
 some japanese operations such as <unk> rooms may be ahead of their american counterparts he says but basically there 's little analysis done on computers in japan 
 of course simply buying computers does n't always solve problems and many american companies have <unk> by purchasing technology they did n't understand 
 but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for japan 's pc lag 
 various cultural and economic forces have <unk> demand 
 because the japanese <unk> is so huge japan has no history of <unk> use and so <unk> <unk> especially among older workers remains a common <unk> 
 i have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery says <unk> <unk> a <unk> executive vice president of japan air lines explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer 
 while most american employees have their own private space japanese <unk> usually share large common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact 
 top japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy <unk> 
 and japan 's management system makes it hard to impose a single integrated computer system <unk> 
 besides a computer processing the japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability while the screen and printer need far better definition to <unk> accurately the <unk> <unk> 
 until recently much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least <unk> 
 some analysts estimate the average pc costs about N N more in japan than the u.s. 
 but the complex language is n't the only reason 
 for the past decade nec corp. has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with <unk> power 
 with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient 
 the u.s. market too is dominated by a giant international business machines corp 
 but early on ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it 
 dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system 
 that <unk> competition and growth allows users to change and mix brands easily and increases software firms ' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer 
 if a record industry lacked a common standard sony cd owners could listen to a sony version of <unk> 's like a <unk> but not one made for a <unk> player 
 that is the state of japan 's computer industry 
 nec wo n't release its code and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own <unk> operating system all <unk> with each other 
 ibm established its standard to try to stop falling behind <unk> apple computer but nec was ahead from the start and did n't need to <unk> in competitive allies 
 meanwhile the big players have n't tried to copy the nec standard 
 corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers help explain why 
 most rivals have a working relationship with nec often through <unk> of technology the japan personal computer software association noted recently 
 they hesitate to market <unk> machines nec <unk> of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship 
 the result according to many analysts is higher prices and less innovation 
 while tens of thousands of software packages using the ibm standard are available in the u.s. they say only about N are written for nec 
 a year ago japan 's fair trade commission warned nec about possible violations of <unk> laws for discouraging retailers from discounting 
 in japan software is four to five years behind the u.s. because hardware is four to five years behind because nec is enjoying a monopoly complains <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> corp. one of japan 's leading <unk> publishing and software companies 
 there are no price wars no competition 
 an nec spokeswoman <unk> that prices are higher in japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the u.s. 
 she adds that some technological advances trail those in the u.s. because the japanese still import basic operating systems from american companies 
 but the market is changing 
 the government is funding several projects to push pc use 
 over the next three years public schools will get N million pcs a <unk> increase from current levels 
 in the private sector practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees ' exposure to computers 
 toyota motor corp. 's sales offices in japan have <unk> the computers per employee that its own u.s. offices do over the next five years it is aiming for rough parity 
 within a year <unk> corp. a major cosmetics company plans to eliminate N <unk> jobs by putting on a central computer network some work such as credit reports currently performed in N separate offices 
 by increasing the number of pcs it uses from N to N <unk> <unk> electronics co. of <unk> hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the company is run 
 managers have long been those who <unk> their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on a spokesman says 
 but new managers will have to be <unk> and <unk> and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily and also shared 
 meanwhile more computer makers now are competing for the new business 
 <unk> <unk> corp. a <unk> to the industry fought off a legal challenge and started selling nec <unk> last year 
 it has won about N N of the retail pc market 
 sony corp. which temporarily dropped out of the pc business three years ago started selling its work station in N and quickly became the leading japanese company in that market 
 in a country where <unk> room is scarce laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry 's future growth 
 toshiba corp. <unk> open that sector this summer with a <unk> machine that <unk> for less than N yen under $ N one of the smallest cheapest pcs available in the country 
 fujitsu ltd. is <unk> the most expensive promotion campaign in its history including a <unk> <unk> at tokyo <unk> for its sophisticated <unk> fm towns machine which it <unk> for everything from <unk> the family <unk> to practicing <unk> bar <unk> 
 many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard 
 two years ago most of the smaller makers joined under the microsoft corp. <unk> to adopt a version of the american ibm at standard 
 that has n't generated much sales but this summer microsoft rallied all the major nec competitors to make their new machines compatible with the ibm <unk> standard 
 a healthy <unk> japanese market could also make it far easier for japanese companies to sell overseas where their share is still minimal 
 but it could also help american companies which also are starting to try to open the market 
 as with many other goods the american share of japan 's pc market is far below that in the rest of the world 
 u.s. makers have under N N share compared with half the market in europe and N N at home 
 though no formal trade barriers exist the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter 
 if it were an open market we would have been in in N or N says <unk> pfeiffer who heads compaq computer corp. 's european and international operations 
 his company without any major effort sells more machines in china than in japan 
 although it has opened a new zealand subsidiary it is still only studying japan the only nation that has n't adopted <unk> specifications 
 and because general retail centers such as <unk> have little presence in japan sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers 
 but the americans are also to blame 
 they long made little effort here 
 ibm though long a leader in the japanese mainframe business did n't introduce its first pc in japan until five years after nec did and that was n't compatible even with the u.s. ibm standard 
 apple did n't introduce a <unk> machine one that handles the chinese characters of written japanese until three years after entering the market 
 critics also say american companies charge too much 
 japan 's ftc says it is investigating apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting 
 but the u.s. companies are <unk> their efforts 
 apple recently hired its first japanese president <unk> away an official of toshiba 's european operations as well as a whole japanese <unk> team 
 earlier this year it introduced a much more powerful <unk> operating system and a <unk> laser printer 
 ibm just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both japanese and english and that substantially <unk> <unk> with its american products 
 it may take five years to break even in japan says john a. <unk> who runs the <unk> office for <unk> & dodge a u.s. software company 
 but it 's an enormous business opportunity 
 from a reading of the somewhat <unk> <unk> medical literature on ru-486 the french abortion pill emerges as one of the <unk> <unk> around 
 this is not only because it <unk> the <unk> a job at which it actually is not <unk> efficient <unk> only N N to N N of them depending on which study you read <unk> taken in <unk> with the pill boosts the rate to N N 
 by contrast surgical abortion is N N effective 
 abortion via the pill is far more of an <unk> than conventional surgical abortion 
 it is <unk> the abortion part alone lasts three days and the clinical part <unk> a week 's worth of visits bloody one woman in a swedish trial required a <unk> although for most it resembles a <unk> period with bleeding lasting an average of N days and painful many women require <unk> shots to ease them through 
 <unk> and <unk> are other common side effects 
 timing is of the <unk> with ru-486 
 it is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her <unk> period up through the seventh week of pregnancy when it is <unk> less effective 
 that is typically about a <unk> window 
 so far all the studies have concluded that ru-486 is safe 
 but safe in the definition of <unk> bass of the reproductive health technologies project means there 's been no evidence so far of mortality 
 no one has <unk> the long-term effects of ru-486 on a woman 's health or <unk> 
 the drug seems to <unk> <unk> for three to seven months after it is taken 
 some women clearly have no trouble eventually <unk> again the studies have reported <unk> in their programs 
 but there are no scientific data on this question 
 rather <unk> <unk> studies reveal that ru-486 can cause birth defects <unk> the british medical journal reported in N 
 however dr. <unk> <unk> the french physician who invented ru-486 wrote in a science magazine article last month that the <unk> results could not be <unk> in <unk> and <unk> 
 the drug has a <unk> structure similar to that of des the <unk> drug that has been linked to <unk> and <unk> cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it 
 all the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves <unk> not carry the pregnancy to term but <unk> a surgical abortion 
 a risk of birth defects a sure source of lawsuits is one reason the u.s. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of ru-486 
 one might well ask why bother with this drug at all 
 some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question 
 ru-486 probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed or at least not very much said <unk> <unk> president of the national abortion federation at a reproductive health conference in N 
 many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion 
 it typically takes from eight to N years to obtain the food and drug administration 's approval for a new drug and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $ N million to $ N million 
 the health and human services department currently <unk> the national institutes of health from funding abortion research as part of its $ N million contraceptive program 
 but the population council a <unk> $ N million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the rockefeller and mellon foundations and currently <unk> most u.s. research on <unk> has recently been paying for u.s. studies of ru-486 on a license from its french developer <unk> a joint subsidiary of the german pharmaceutical company hoechst and the french government 
 in the year since the pill went on the french market the national organization for women and its <unk> former now president <unk> <unk> 's fund for a <unk> majority have been trying to <unk> the u.s. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved 
 its <unk> prediction the pill will be available in the u.s. either legally or illegally in no more than N years 
 following the <unk> and <unk> lead has been a generally <unk> press 
 a june N article in mother jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance 
 for a woman whose period is late using ru-486 means no waiting no walking past picket lines at abortion <unk> and no feet up in <unk> for surgery <unk> health writer <unk> fraser 
 it also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant 
 wrong on all counts miss fraser 
 ru-486 is being <unk> in france only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor 
 <unk> reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none <unk> into the black market 
 thus a woman who used ru-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines an initial visit for medical <unk> <unk> and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated and to take the pill a second trip N hours later for the <unk> <unk> either via injection or <unk> <unk> and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted 
 furthermore because timing is so critical with ru-486 she will learn via a <unk> examination and <unk> not only that she is pregnant but just how pregnant she is 
 no doctor who fears <unk> liability would likely <unk> a <unk> patient to the risk of hemorrhaging 
 many women may even see the dead embryo they have expelled a sight the <unk> industry typically <unk> them 
 at seven weeks an embryo is about <unk> of an inch long and <unk> human 
 at the <unk> of pro-choice members of congress a four-year <unk> bill for title x federal <unk> assistance now contains a $ N million grant for development evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices drugs and methods 
 if this passes a senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time 
 it also could put the government into the ru-486 business which would please <unk> <unk> at what they view as <unk> in the private-sector drug industry 
 we do not know whether ru-486 will be as <unk> as some of the earlier <unk> methods released to <unk> <unk> <unk> from educated people who should have known better 
 remember the dalkon shield and the early <unk> pills 
 we will not know until a first generation of female guinea pigs all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time 
 mrs. allen is a senior editor of insight magazine 
 this article is adapted from one in the october american <unk> 
 on june N a major part of our trade deficit went <unk> 
 no figure <unk> no <unk> just <unk> improved recording of some of our exports 
 the result 
 the commerce department found that u.s. exports in N net of imports were <unk> by $ N billion a year and <unk> at the annualized rate of $ N billion in the first quarter of N 
 more than half of the newly found net exports were from just a few <unk> categories 
 some of the biggest <unk> exporters american <unk> companies for example have yet to be fully included in our export statistics 
 nearly N years ago representatives of <unk> companies worked out a plan with the commerce department to improve the data on <unk> exports 
 both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports such as <unk> tourism legal accounting and other professional services <unk> to foreigners financial engineering and construction services and the like were not being counted as exports 
 the monthly trade deficit figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade manufactured goods and raw materials 
 in the quarterly <unk> report those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services as well as returns on investments abroad by americans and returns on foreign investments in the u.s. 
 over time through benchmark surveys the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered 
 the first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the u.s. net after expenditures by americans studying abroad some exports by professional firms a law firm billing a german client for services <unk> in watching legislation in washington is as much an export as shipment of an american jet engine and improved data from travel and tourism 
 in just these three areas the commerce department found $ N billion more exports than previously reported and $ N billion more imports with the net result that the u.s. service surplus in N increased by $ N billion to $ N billion 
 combined with <unk> and revisions in other trade areas the value of u.s. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ N billion a year 
 that means that the u.s. trade deficit was running closer to $ N billion than to $ N billion in N and $ N billion annualized rather than $ N billion in the first quarter of N 
 these revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar 
 the <unk> smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market 
 what does this mean for trade policy 
 too early to tell but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we <unk> does suggest a review of our trade posture 
 it does not relieve the need for our <unk> efforts for both goods and services but it does suggest that it is our exports of services and not just borrowing that is financing our imports of goods

 the collapse of a $ N billion labor-management buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. may not stop some of wall street 's top talent from collecting up to $ N million in fees 
 according to one person familiar with the airline the buy-out group led by united 's pilots union and ual chairman stephen wolf has begun billing ual for fees and expenses it owes to investment bankers law firms and banks 
 the <unk> even covers $ N million in commitment fees owed to citicorp and chase manhattan corp. even though their failure to obtain $ N billion in bank loans for the buy-out was the main reason for its collapse 
 under a merger agreement reached sept. N the ual board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out group 's expenses out of company funds even if the transaction was n't completed provided the group did n't breach the agreement 
 the failure to obtain financing does n't by itself constitute a breach 
 the merger agreement says the buy-out group is entitled to be repaid $ N million in fees for its investment bankers lazard <unk> & co. and salomon brothers inc. and its law firm paul weiss <unk> <unk> & garrison 
 the buy-out group is also entitled to $ N million to repay a fund created by the pilots union for an employee stock ownership plan 
 in addition to the $ N million for citicorp and chase salomon brothers is also owed $ N million for promising to make a $ N million bridge loan 
 a spokesman for the buy-out group was n't immediately available for comment 
 separately ual stock rose $ N a share to $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange on reports that los angeles investor marvin davis has asked united airlines unions if they 're interested in <unk> with mr. davis in a new bid for ual 
 but neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested and mr. davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with ual in september unless ual <unk> an offer below $ N a share 
 wall street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading 
 kidder peabody & co. a unit of general electric co. announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account and merrill lynch & co. pulled out of the practice altogether 
 at the new york stock exchange which has been <unk> by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange 's own listed companies chairman john j. phelan jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the big board 's N stock specialist firms 
 the specialists a trader said were <unk> about mr. phelan 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are here to stay 
 many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market including the 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average on oct. N 
 a specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock 
 mr. phelan 's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange 's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow according to exchange officials 
 a big board spokesman would only say we 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue 
 the program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant contel corp. said it and N or more of the big board 's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange 's role in program trading 
 the decision by merrill the nation 's largest securities firm represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading 
 merrill has been the <unk> stock-index arbitrage trader on the big board this year executing an average of N million shares a month in such trades or about one million shares a day 
 merrill 's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading <unk> of recent days because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers 
 most wall street firms in pulling back have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts 
 merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers 
 merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading including tough margin or <unk> requirements and limits on price moves for <unk> financial futures 
 merrill in a statement by chairman william a. <unk> and president daniel p. <unk> said index arbitrage has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility so merrill wo n't execute such trades until effective controls are in place 
 in stock-index arbitrage traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options 
 the idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets 
 last thursday painewebber group inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether but the firm was n't as big an index <unk> as merrill is 
 other large firms including bear stearns & co. and morgan stanley & co. last week announced a <unk> from index arbitrage but only for the firms ' own accounts 
 kidder made an abrupt <unk> on program trading yesterday after a special meeting between the firm 's president and chief executive officer michael carpenter and its senior managers 
 just a week ago mr. carpenter <unk> defended index arbitrage at kidder the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year 
 index arbitrage mr. carpenter said last week does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole and kidder 's customers were sophisticated enough to know that 
 but yesterday mr. carpenter said big institutional investors which he would n't identify told us they would n't do business with firms that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts 
 we were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions he said 
 kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of N million shares in index-arbitrage trading and is second only to morgan stanley in overall program trading which includes index arbitrage 
 most of kidder 's program trading is for its own account according to the new york stock exchange 
 kidder denied that ge 's chairman and chief executive john f. welch had anything to do with kidder 's decision 
 but at least one chief executive said he called mr. welch to complain about kidder 's aggressive use of program trading and other market sources said they understood that mr. welch received many phone calls complaining about kidder 's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business 
 kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that ge makes decisions for its kidder unit 
 our decision had nothing to do with any pressure mr. welch received mr. carpenter said 
 this was a kidder peabody <unk> decision 
 a spokeswoman for ge in fairfield conn. said absolutely no one spoke to jack welch on this subject and added anyone who claims they talked to jack welch is n't telling the truth 
 supporters of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy as some did during the post-crash outcry of N 
 but merrill lynch in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage suggested that the current debate has missed the mark 
 merrill said it continues to believe that the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy 
 indeed there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries 
 merrill 's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of <unk> program trading so there probably wo n't be any layoffs at the firm people familiar with merrill 's program operation said 
 meanwhile bear stearns chairman and chief executive alan c. greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients 
 at the firm 's annual meeting last night he told shareholders that index arbitrage wo n't go away despite the public outcry 
 if they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few wall street firms to quit they are crazy mr. greenberg said 
 it 's not going to stop it at all 
 mr. greenberg noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and <unk> with stock market 's volatility said that for the first four months of the firm 's fiscal year beginning in july stock-index arbitrage had been a break-even proposition for bear stearns 
 in response to a shareholder 's suggestion mr. greenberg agreed that european firms will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by u.s. institutions 
 pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for wall street 's program-trading <unk> 
 and there was speculation yesterday that fidelity investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of kemper corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading 
 a fidelity spokesman in boston denied the speculation saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem 
 but a much smaller mutual fund company the <unk> investment management co. unit of <unk> san antonio texas said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading 
 <unk> with N mutual fund accounts manages more than $ N billion $ N billion of which is in the stock market 
 michael j.c. roth <unk> executive vice president called program trading <unk> 
 he said there is no valid investment reason for stock-index futures to exist 
 a <unk> move is clearly on 
 charles wohlstetter chairman of contel who is helping <unk> the alliance of big <unk> firms said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls <unk> and letters supporting his view that the big board has been turned into a gambling casino by program traders 
 we are reaching the moment of truth on wall street said rep. edward j. markey d. mass. chairman of the house subcommittee on telecommunications and finance

 the supreme court agreed to decide whether the federal pension benefit guaranty corp. may require ltv corp. to <unk> funding responsibility for a $ N billion <unk> in the company 's pension plans 
 the high court 's decision expected next spring may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency 
 the agency which is funded through insurance premiums from employers <unk> pension benefits for some N million private-sector workers who take part in <unk> pension plans 
 it recently reported assets of $ N billion and liabilities of $ N billion 
 in its appeal to the high court the agency said the federal appeals court ruling which favored ltv threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an <unk> source of industry <unk> 
 the ruling also may determine how quickly ltv is able to complete its chapter N reorganization 
 ltv filed for protection under chapter N in federal bankruptcy court in N 
 the filing was partly the result of the $ N billion <unk> in ltv 's three pension plans operated for its ltv steel co. subsidiary 's employees 
 in january N as ltv steel continued operating while under reorganization the agency terminated the three ltv pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing 
 termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans but workers do n't <unk> new benefits 
 a few months later under pressure from the united steelworkers of america ltv instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans 
 because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans ltv would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans 
 but the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $ N billion <unk> from ltv to federal insurance 
 the agency also concluded that ltv 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization 
 in september N it ordered ltv to <unk> liability and funding for the three original plans 
 ltv challenged the order and a federal district court in new york in june N ruled that the agency improperly ordered ltv to <unk> responsibility for the plans 
 in may a federal appeals court in new york agreed that the agency acted <unk> 
 the appeals court said there was no evidence that congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to <unk> liability for old plans 
 the appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans not just short-term improved financial status 
 in dallas ltv said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its chapter N proceedings 
 the company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan in part because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency 
 but ltv a steel aerospace and energy concern said it is confident that the supreme court will <unk> the <unk> decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed

 the supreme court let stand a new york court 's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent <unk> must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual <unk> is unknown 
 the high court 's action refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies is likely to have a significant impact at several levels 
 the most immediate effect is in new york where former manufacturers of the <unk> drug des the synthetic female <unk> <unk> face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the N to N des lawsuits pending in that state 
 the lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug 
 on a broader scale the ruling could encourage other states ' courts to adopt the logic of the new york court not only in des cases but in other <unk> lawsuits as well 
 the new york court of appeals ruling parallels a N decision by the california supreme court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it ca n't be determined which company is at fault 
 paul <unk> a new york lawyer who represents des victims said that before the new york ruling only the states of washington and wisconsin had followed the california decision 
 now that the new york decision has been left intact other states may follow suit 
 generally when new york and california go one way it has a tremendous influence on other states especially small ones said mr. <unk> 
 the high court refused to hear appeals by <unk> drug co. which went out of business in N and was taken over by <unk> <unk> trust <unk> squibb & sons inc. a unit of squibb corp. and eli lilly & co 
 the appeals involved des which was approved by the food and drug administration for use from the <unk> until N to prevent <unk> during pregnancy 
 in N the fda banned the use of des after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug 
 lawsuits over the harm caused by des have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade 
 in many cases the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the <unk> consumed by certain women 
 under traditional legal theories inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed 
 but in its ruling last april the new york court said that all producers of the <unk> drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific <unk> ca n't be determined 
 each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national des market 
 the new york court also upheld a state law passed in N extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing des lawsuits 
 the effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension

 government contractors 
 the high court leaving intact a $ N million damage award against general dynamics corp. declined to resolve questions about a legal defense against civil lawsuits often used by government contractors 
 last year the supreme court defined when companies such as military contractors may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by <unk> that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract 
 in that decision the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment 
 but last february a federal appeals court in new orleans upheld a damage award against general dynamics rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense 
 the appeals court said the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber <unk> a company 's design or plans and engaged in a <unk> review and evaluation on a par with a policy decision 
 general dynamics appealed to the high court backed by numerous business trade groups arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely 
 general dynamics was sued by the families of five navy <unk> who were killed in N after they <unk> a <unk> through a <unk> chamber

 it can be hoped that spanish prime minister <unk> gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory sunday 
 a strong challenge from the far left the communist coalition <unk> <unk> failed to topple him 
 he should consider his victory a mandate to continue his <unk> economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left 
 if he follows the correct path he may be able to look back on this election as the <unk> mark of <unk> opposition

 it could point to plenty of <unk> that the spanish economic <unk> so far has failed to cure

 mr. gonzalez and his colleagues particularly the finance minister carlos <unk> are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant <unk> who refuse even to go on television controlled by the state to face their <unk> 
 in response to this the socialist prime minister has simply cited his free-market <unk>

 mr. gonzalez also has split with the left in <unk> spain 's nato commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the u.s. 
 mr. gonzalez is not quite a <unk> <unk> revolutionary however 
 he did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes 
 yet the best the <unk> could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc nearly N N from <unk> the direction spain is taking 
 now he can go further 
 he should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher not lower revenues 
 he could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers thus making funds available for public services <unk> of money for six years 
 the voters delivered mr. gonzalez a third mandate for his successes 
 they as well as numerous latin american and east european countries that hope to adopt elements of the spanish model are supporting the direction spain is taking

 the treasury department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the u.s. 
 in recent testimony on capitol hill treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements and the expected publication of the proposal in the federal register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations 
 the treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering 
 among the possibilities the treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the <unk> and recipients of international wire transfers 
 another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money <unk> by developing a <unk> international wire transfer profile which banks would use to <unk> questionable payments 
 but banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions rather than a blanket reporting requirement

 western union corp. took steps to withdraw its proposed debt swap for $ N million in high-interest notes and said it is looking at other alternatives for refinancing the debt 
 western union had said two weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer which would have replaced $ N million in so-called reset notes now paying N N annual interest and set to come due in N with two new issues paying lower interest 
 yesterday the company said it had filed a request with the securities and exchange commission to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap 
 a western union spokesman citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield junk bonds declined to say what alternatives are under consideration 
 but some holders of the western union notes expect the company to propose a <unk> debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the company 
 western union has had major losses in recent years as its <unk> business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone <unk> 
 the major question said one holder who asked not to be named is whether new york investor bennett s. <unk> whose <unk> partners controls western union is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to <unk> bondholders into agreeing to a new swap 
 the $ N million in notes the largest chunk of western union 's $ N million in long-term debt stems from the company 's major restructuring in december N 
 the notes became <unk> when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to N N last june 
 western union had offered to swap each $ N face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues a $ N note paying an interest rate starting at N N annually and rising in later years due in N and a $ N note due in N paying a fixed rate of N N and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond 
 western union must make $ N million in interest payments on the reset notes on dec. N and a company spokesman said it fully intends to meet the payments

 medical scientists are starting to <unk> a handful of genes which if damaged <unk> the chaotic growth of cells that <unk> cancer 
 scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops 
 an emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention 
 that is for the future 
 already scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that for the first time can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer 
 it 's a <unk> set of <unk> says <unk> vogelstein a johns hopkins university researcher who has just found a gene <unk> to the triggering of colon cancer 
 only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the <unk> level 
 today we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can <unk> a cancer and then <unk> it into a deadly state 
 scientists call the new class of genes <unk> or simply <unk> genes 
 when <unk> normally they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check 
 but if the genes are damaged perhaps by radiation a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division their <unk> proteins no longer work and cells normally under control turn malignant 
 the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called <unk> 
 <unk> must be present for a cell to become malignant but researchers have found them in normal as well as in <unk> cells suggesting that <unk> do n't cause cancer by themselves 
 in recent months researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert an <unk> may turn <unk> cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged 
 like all genes tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies one from each parent 
 either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth so for cancer to arise both copies must be <unk> 
 a person who is born with one defective copy of a <unk> gene or in whom one copy is damaged early in life is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop 
 emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such <unk> individuals <unk> in what some scientists believe is a new age of <unk> cancer <unk> 
 bill and <unk> <unk> are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings 
 the <unk> mass. couple knew even before <unk> became pregnant in N that any child of theirs had a N N chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma an eye cancer that occurs about once every N <unk> 
 mr. <unk> N years old knew he carried a damaged gene having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby 
 because of the <unk> of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene it became possible last january to find out what threat the <unk> baby faced 
 a test using new genetic <unk> showed that little will <unk> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma <unk> gene and therefore faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer 
 it made our new year says mr. <unk> 
 this test was the first to predict <unk> whether an individual could expect to develop cancer 
 equally important the initial discovery of the gene that controls <unk> cell growth made by a boston doctor named <unk> <unk> has opened a field of cancer study which in recent months has exploded 
 it turns out that studying a <unk> but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental <unk> about the most basic workings of cancer says samuel <unk> director of the national cancer institute 
 all this may not be obvious to the public which is concerned about advances in treatment but i am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon 
 to date scientists have <unk> two of these <unk> 
 dr. <unk> made his retinoblastoma discovery in N 
 then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which if <unk> turns healthy colon cells <unk> 
 soon after that report two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and <unk> cancers 
 colon lung and <unk> cancers are the most common and <unk> forms of the disease <unk> killing almost N americans a year 
 right now about a dozen laboratories in the u.s. canada and britain are racing to <unk> other suspected <unk> genes 
 they have about seven candidates 
 researchers say the <unk> of tumor-suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such <unk> as cancer of the brain the skin kidney <unk> and <unk> 
 there is evidence that if people <unk> defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to <unk> certain families 
 the story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s when a <unk> named alfred g. <unk> jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects 
 he <unk> that in the eye cancer an <unk> inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other 
 the tumor he suggested developed when the second normal copy also was damaged 
 but there was no way to prove dr. <unk> 's <unk> theory 
 back then scientists had no way of <unk> out specific genes but under a <unk> they could see the N <unk> of <unk> in the cells that contain the genes 
 occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible 
 dr. <unk> found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no. N from a parent who had had the disease 
 under a <unk> he could actually see that a bit of chromosome N was missing 
 he assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer 
 but he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared 
 then a scientific team led by <unk> <unk> webster <unk> then at the university of utah found the answer 
 the team used a battery of the newly developed gene <unk> <unk> of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell 
 by analyzing cells <unk> from eye <unk> they found defects in the second copy of chromosome N in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome 
 the finding <unk> medicine 
 it was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the <unk> of a cancer 
 it was extraordinarily satisfying says dr. <unk> now at fox chase cancer research center in philadelphia 
 i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers 
 it was an <unk> claim 
 but in baltimore dr. vogelstein a young <unk> <unk> at johns hopkins medical school believed dr. <unk> was right and set out to repeat the <unk> experiment in cells from other cancers 
 his was one of two research teams in N to report dual chromosome losses for a rare <unk> cancer of the kidney called <unk> 's tumor 
 dr. vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer 
 he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer <unk> genes because it often seems to develop in stages 
 it often is <unk> by the development of <unk> in the <unk> which in some cases become increasingly malignant in <unk> stages <unk> from less severe to deadly as though a cascade of genetic damage might be <unk> 
 dr. vogelstein and a <unk> student eric <unk> began months of <unk> and often frustrating probing of the <unk> searching for signs of genetic damage 
 they began <unk> a confusing variety of genetic <unk> some existing only in benign <unk> others in malignant cells and many in both <unk> and malignant cells 
 gradually a <unk> picture of cancer development emerged 
 if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign <unk> would develop 
 if both copies of a second gene were then <unk> the <unk> would progress to <unk> 
 it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop 
 their report galvanized other <unk> <unk> 
 it was the confirming evidence we all needed that gene losses were critical to the development of a common tumor says ray white at howard hughes medical institute in salt lake city 
 but dr. vogelstein had yet to <unk> the identity of the gene that if damaged <unk> a colon cell into <unk> <unk> 
 they focused on chromosome N 
 for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene <unk> <unk> <unk> down the length of chromosome N looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells 
 such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene 
 when they found it last winter dr. vogelstein was dubious that the search was over 
 his doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a princeton university researcher arnold levine had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into <unk> ones 
 the <unk> dr. vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 
 but mr. levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth <unk> the johns hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that <unk> growth 
 despite that when the johns hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the mr. levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical it turned out that in mr. levine 's cancer studies he had <unk> been <unk> a damaged form of p53 a <unk> gene 
 the discovery suddenly puts an <unk> gene right in the <unk> of cancer formation says robert <unk> a leader in <unk> research at <unk> institute in cambridge mass 
 evidence now is emerging that the p53 <unk> gene is involved in other cancers too 
 researchers in <unk> scotland have found that in N of N <unk> <unk> one copy of chromosome N was <unk> at the spot where gene p53 lies 
 the scientists say that since <unk> cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may <unk> women to the cancer 
 the p53 gene has just been <unk> in lung cancer 
 in a report out last week john <unk> and colleagues at the national cancer institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene 
 there also are reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers 
 at the same time the johns hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes 
 dr. vogelstein hopes soon to <unk> one on chromosome N also involved in colon cancer 
 ray white in utah and walter <unk> a researcher in great britain are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer thought to be on chromosome N 
 dr. <unk> believes people who <unk> a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome N are especially prone to lung cancer 
 recently he and others reported that the retinoblastoma <unk> gene may also be involved in some lung cancers as well as several other more common cancers too 
 where these <unk> will lead scientists can only speculate 
 already two major pharmaceutical companies the squibb unit of bristol-myers squibb co. and <unk> <unk> inc. are <unk> with gene <unk> to turn the anticipated cascade of <unk> into <unk> tests and maybe new <unk> 
 some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the <unk> proteins normally produced by the genes 
 the idea would be to <unk> to patients the <unk> proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes 
 it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions though no one has come close to doing that so far 
 in any case says dr. <unk> of the national cancer institute we 're <unk> the discovery of one of the most important steps in the <unk> of cancer 
 many investors give michael foods about as much chance of getting it together as <unk> <unk> 
 but now at least there 's a <unk> of hope for the stock 
 burger king which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by michael foods 
 known as easy eggs the product has disappointed investors 
 when the company this month announced <unk> sales of easy eggs the stock dropped nearly N N 
 michael wo n't confirm the <unk> of any easy egg customers nor will it say much of anything else 
 two minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making various <unk> statements 
 these <unk> suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that easy eggs were unlikely to sell <unk> enough to justify all of michael 's production capacity 
 but at least burger king has signed on and says that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs 
 the miami fast-food chain owned by grand metropolitan of britain expects to consume roughly N million pounds of <unk> eggs annually 
 so there is reason to believe that michael 's hopes for a <unk> <unk> egg were n't all <unk> 
 easy eggs are <unk> in a <unk> process 
 still caution is <unk> 
 a company official says michael 's break-even volume on easy eggs is around N million pounds a year apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a <unk> market waiting for such a product 
 perhaps to <unk> the analysts ' talk of <unk> michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new <unk> minn. plant 
 there has been no announcement of the burger king arrangement by either party possibly for fear that mcdonald 's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in <unk> advertising 
 but burger king operators <unk> confirm using michael 's product 
 other institutional users reportedly include <unk> which is moving away from fresh eggs on a <unk> basis 
 the extent of <unk> 's use is n't known and <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment 
 michael foods has attracted a good many <unk> the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender 
 many analysts question management 's credibility 
 the stock in my opinion is going to go lower not only because of disappointing earnings but because the credibility gap is certainly not closing says l. craig <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
 mr. <unk> says that at a recent <unk> conference in new york he asked michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down 
 the ceo richard g. <unk> replied yes but would n't elaborate 
 the company did n't put out a public announcement 
 a spokesman said later that mr. <unk> was being conservative in his estimate 
 but the spokesman added that while michael will earn less than last year 's $ N a share it thinks street estimates of $ N or so are low 
 analyst robin young of john <unk> & co. minneapolis calls himself the last remaining bull on the stock 
 he argues that michael foods is <unk> this is a growth company in the packaged food industry a rare breed like finding a white <unk> 
 earnings are n't keeping pace he says because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and <unk> costs in its potato business 
 mr. <unk> however believes the company 's egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run even though it makes sense it 's more convenient and justifies its price which is higher than shell eggs because of health and <unk> concerns 
 prospective competition is one problem 
 last week a closely held new jersey concern <unk> high-grade egg products co. rolled out an <unk> packaged <unk> item called table ready 
 company president steve <unk> says <unk> will be among his clients as well 
 michael shares closed at N N yesterday in national over-the-counter trading 
 says new york-based short seller mark <unk> in my mind this is a $ N stock 
 michael late yesterday announced a $ N million stock buy-back program 
 michael which also processes potatoes still relies on <unk> for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit 
 but dry growing conditions in the red river valley of minnesota and north <unk> are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what michael contracted to pay last spring 
 company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that michael would take very seriously any effort to <unk> its <unk> potatoes to other outlets 
 still analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year 
 pierre peladeau a canadian newspaper publisher <unk> in the u.s. figures to become a big player in north american printing and his ambitions do n't end there 
 yesterday quebecor inc. a montreal printing publishing and forest-products company <unk> by mr. peladeau agreed to acquire maxwell communication corp. 's u.s. printing subsidiary maxwell graphics inc. for $ N million in cash and securities 
 the purchase expected to be completed by year end will make quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in north america behind only <unk> <unk> & sons co. chicago 
 the printing customers that quebecor will gain through maxwell graphics include the sunday newspaper supplement parade time sports illustrated and tv guide 
 but the transaction is just mr. peladeau 's latest step in a larger design to build quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout north america 
 he already has achieved <unk> integration on a limited scale quebecor can put a weekly newspaper on almost any quebec <unk> without using outside help from <unk> down the tree to making the newsprint to <unk> it up onto the <unk> 
 analysts say quebecor 's purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the north american printing industry 
 along with <unk> says <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> thomson <unk> inc. in montreal quebecor has positioned itself as one of the two key players 
 he adds i think this is a great strategic move for quebecor 
 they are buying an operation that is running well 
 mr. peladeau says he is n't trying to catch up to <unk> which has annual sales of over $ N billion 
 size does n't matter mr. peladeau says 
 what counts is the bottom line 
 some of mr. peladeau 's ventures including an earlier push into the u.s. market have n't paid off on the bottom line 
 quebecor started the philadelphia journal a daily tabloid in N and closed it three years later 
 the venture cost quebecor $ N million mr. peladeau says 
 more recently some former quebecor executives started their own printing company specializing in printing and distributing advertising <unk> 
 quebecor still <unk> in the quebec <unk> market while mr. peladeau 's former employees are expanding across canada 
 mr. peladeau took his first big gamble N years ago when he took advantage of a strike at la <unk> then montreal 's dominant <unk> newspaper to launch the journal de montreal 
 the tabloid 's circulation soared to N but plunged to under N when the la <unk> strike ended 
 still mr. peladeau stuck with the venture 
 now the journal flush with ads and <unk> profitable is even with la <unk> in weekend circulation and <unk> it N to N every <unk> 
 mr. peladeau has never made any <unk> for publishing the tabloid a <unk> mix of crime and sports 
 i 've read <unk> he answers critics 
 it 's tabloid news from a to z 
 quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in montreal the struggling <unk> montreal daily news <unk> in quebec city and <unk> manitoba and dozens of <unk> covering most of quebec 
 a series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in quebec 
 after a recent merger it is also the only <unk> distributor of magazines and newspapers in quebec 
 finally with maxwell communication the company controls N N of <unk> inc. a quebec city pulp and paper concern 
 in yesterday 's accord quebecor agreed to pay $ N million in cash for maxwell graphics and to give maxwell communication a N N stake valued at $ N million in quebecor 's new printing subsidiary 
 the new as yet <unk> subsidiary will combine quebecor 's existing printing unit and maxwell graphics 
 it will have N plants from coast to coast and $ N billion in annual sales 
 quebecor will own N N of the new subsidiary 
 <unk> de <unk> <unk> placement the quebec government <unk> agency will pay $ N million for the remaining N N stake in the printing operation 
 <unk> peladeau the founder 's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition says quebecor has n't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase but he says it most likely will use debt 
 the maxwell deal is quebecor 's second big printing acquisition in just over a year 
 last october quebecor bought N canadian printing plants from <unk> inc. a montreal telecommunications manufacturing energy and real estate company 
 that purchase doubled quebecor 's annual printing revenue to $ N million 
 maxwell 's sale of its u.s. printing unit was expected the last major business to be <unk> of in a major <unk> of assets 
 according to its most recent annual report covering the N months ended march N maxwell communication bought $ N billion in assets including macmillan inc. and official airlines <unk> and sold $ N billion in <unk> businesses 
 now maxwell founder robert maxwell says he has an appetite for new acquisitions in the u.s. adding that he could spend a good deal more than $ N billion on another u.s. purchase

 the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission sued new york state for age discrimination against appointed state judges 
 the suit filed in federal court in manhattan charges that new york 's mandatory retirement age of N violates federal law 
 separately the commission intervened in a connecticut state judge 's <unk> suit in federal court in new haven 
 the commission 's filing in that case challenges connecticut 's mandatory retirement age of N for appointed judges 
 the new york suit was filed on behalf of justice <unk> rubin whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination 
 the suit assigned to federal judge <unk> wood seeks a permanent injunction back pay for judges who have been forced to retire <unk> of retired judges and other <unk> relief necessary to <unk> the effects of new york 's unlawful employment practices 
 justice rubin a state judge since N said the <unk> age <unk> the court system because it <unk> the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench 
 the issue is n't age age is just a number 
 the issue is one of a judge 's experience his <unk> and his physical ability to serve on the bench justice rubin said 
 i 've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities 
 because justice rubin turned N on may N he is n't eligible to be <unk> to the bench at the end of the year 
 the suit 's impact on new york may be narrow however 
 most new york judges are elected and the federal <unk> law does n't apply to elected officials said james l. lee regional attorney for the <unk> in new york 
 under new york law elected judges must retire at age N but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach N 
 a spokeswoman for the state 's office of court administration declined to comment on the suit

 organized crime strike forces likely to be abolished next month 
 u.s. attorney general dick thornburgh 's plan to <unk> the N regional <unk> strike forces is expected to go into effect next month despite the opposition of democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units 
 the units are <unk> from u.s. attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on <unk> <unk> cases 
 in february mr. thornburgh announced his plan to abolish the units 
 he says the <unk> lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of u.s. attorneys 
 mr. thornburgh will be free to <unk> the strike forces after congress approves a $ N million <unk> for federal law-enforcement and <unk> agencies according to david runkel a justice department spokesman 
 the bill is expected to pass in congress next month 
 congress temporarily halted mr. thornburgh 's effort with an <unk> resolution that prohibited him from using <unk> funds to implement his plan 
 opponents say mr. thornburgh 's plan will <unk> break up longtime tightly <unk> <unk> units that have successfully prosecuted major <unk> figures 
 they predict that <unk> activity will increase once the units are <unk> and their responsibilities transferred to u.s. attorneys ' offices 
 some former <unk> personnel say the units have already begun to break up 
 the eastern district unit in brooklyn n.y. lost seven of its N attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization says <unk> a. <unk> who left the strike force to join morrison cohen singer & <unk> a new york law firm

 but mr. runkel contends there has been no exodus of <unk> lawyers 
 he says N lawyers have left and N have been hired since mr. thornburgh announced his plan 
 at the time the plan was announced there were N lawyers 
 some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces 
 a spokesman for sen. edward m. kennedy d. mass says mr. thornburgh would be required to <unk> the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed 
 among other things the bill calls for a reorganization of the justice department 
 the senate is expected to consider the bill shortly says the senator 's spokesman

 warner communications inc. and sony corp. resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over hollywood producers peter guber and jon peters but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents 
 warner has filed a $ N billion breach of contract suit in los angeles superior court against sony and the guber-peters duo who in turn are <unk> warner for trying to interfere in sony 's acquisition of columbia pictures entertainment inc. and guber peters entertainment co. in two transactions valued at over $ N billion 
 although settlement talks had been dropped attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before thursday when a judge is expected to rule on warner 's request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of columbia 
 yesterday in documents filed in connection with that case warner accused sony officials of <unk> claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for columbia citing securities and exchange commission filings made by sony that described the contracts 
 warner was referring to documents filed last week in which sony corp. of america vice chairman michael <unk> and walter yetnikoff president of its cbs records unit said they had taken mr. guber and mr. peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement 
 wayne smith an attorney at <unk> dunn & <unk> in los angeles representing sony said the sony executives had n't seen the contract because it was n't relevant once guber and peters told them warner would let them terminate it at any time 
 mr. smith said statements about the contract made in sec filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't part of the negotiations between sony and the duo 
 warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by messrs. guber and peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up 
 but mr. smith said sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio 
 warner described as nonsense yesterday sony 's <unk> in prior court filings that mr. guber and mr. peters could in theory run columbia while still <unk> their contract to produce movies for warner 
 such a dual role would be <unk> and <unk> warner said adding that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the los angeles <unk> could simultaneously be general manager of the san francisco giants 
 warner which is in the process of being acquired by new york-based time warner inc. also said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $ N million 
 dataproducts inc. said it filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court to block a tender offer by dpc acquisition partners alleging that the hostile offer violates a standstill agreement between the two concerns 
 dpc an investor group led by new york-based <unk> investment associates had itself filed a suit in state court in los angeles seeking to <unk> the agreement 
 earlier this year dataproducts had rejected a $ N a share offer from dpc saying it was n't adequately financed 
 dpc last week launched a new $ <unk> offer for the <unk> hills calif.-based computer printer maker 
 dpc said it could n't comment on the suit 
 boeing co. 's third-quarter profit leaped N N but wall street 's attention was focused on the picket line not the bottom line 
 in fact the earnings report <unk> as representatives of the world 's no. N jet maker and the striking machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks 
 doug hammond the federal mediator in seattle where boeing is based said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again 
 despite the progress boeing indicated that the work <unk> now in its <unk> day will have a serious adverse impact on the current quarter 
 for the third quarter net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 sales climbed N N to $ N billion from $ N billion as the company capitalized on the <unk> global demand for commercial <unk> 
 because it 's impossible to gauge how long the <unk> by N machinists rank and file will last the precise impact on boeing 's sales earnings cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined 
 the investment community however strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either boeing or its work force 
 the company 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at sept. N stood at a mighty $ N billion compared with $ N billion at the end of 
 although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ N billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year those dollars actually would just be deferred until N 
 and the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other <unk> employees on hand 
 before the union rejected the company 's offer and the strike was launched with the <unk> shift of oct. N boeing had been counting on turning N aircraft out the door in the present period 
 that included N of the company 's N jumbo jets its most successful product 
 it 's not a pretty picture said david smith an analyst with raymond james & associates 
 but it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year 
 <unk> <unk> of merrill lynch capital markets added you do n't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it 
 but the strike has n't gone on long enough for boeing to lose business in any real sense 
 that 's the primary reason the company 's share price has held up so well when in mr. smith 's words most companies would have unraveled by now 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading boeing closed yesterday at $ N a share off a <unk> N cents 
 still boeing went through its normal <unk> <unk> and played up the downside 
 in a statement chairman frank <unk> asserted that the company faces significant challenges and risks on both its commercial and government contracts 
 for instance he noted that spending on pentagon programs is shrinking and boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects including the b-2 <unk> bomber the <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft and the air force 's <unk> tactical fighter 
 because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work mr. <unk> said the company 's defense business will record a significant loss in N 
 moreover mr. <unk> added <unk> increases that have been implemented on the N N N and N programs have resulted in serious work force <unk> problems 
 suppliers and <unk> are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules 
 and of course there 's the <unk> labor situation 
 besides the machinists pact accords representing N of the company 's engineering and technical employees in the <unk> sound and wichita kan. areas expire in early december 
 also a contract with the united auto workers at the company 's helicopter plant in philadelphia expired oct. N 
 this contract covering about N hourly production and maintenance workers is being extended on a day-to-day basis 
 the machinists rejected a proposal featuring a N N base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract plus bonuses of N N the first year and N N the second 
 on top of that boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be N N for each year of the contract 
 the union though has called the offer <unk> 
 the company reiterated yesterday that it 's willing to <unk> the package but not add to the substance of it 
 for the nine months boeing 's net increased N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales soared N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 in a separate matter the justice department yesterday said boeing agreed to pay the government $ N million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the air force while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum <unk> on the <unk> tanker aircraft 
 the settlement <unk> to four contracts negotiated from N to N prosecutors said 
 they added that the settlement is the culmination of a N 1\/2-year investigation into the company 's aluminum pricing practices in connection with <unk> 
 a boeing spokesman responded all along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution 
 that was <unk> out by the justice department 's decision to settle the case 
 foothills pipe lines ltd. filed an application with canadian regulators to build a N billion canadian dollar us$ N billion pipeline to transport natural gas from canada 's arctic to u.s. markets beginning in 
 the application by foothills owned by calgary-based <unk> corp. of alberta and <unk> energy inc. of vancouver canada is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from <unk> fields in canada 's mackenzie river delta 
 this is a <unk> strike by foothills said rick <unk> natural gas manager of the calgary-based independent petroleum association of canada an industry group 
 foothills wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it 's on first <unk> as <unk> gas from the arctic to southern markets mr. <unk> said 
 at least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months including one from transcanada pipelines ltd. canada 's largest natural gas pipeline operator 
 another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from canada 's national energy board to export about N trillion cubic feet of mackenzie delta gas to the u.s. starting in N

 the toronto-based company together with tenneco inc. of houston has had an incomplete proposal filed with canadian regulators since N that it is now <unk> 
 like foothills transcanada 's <unk> gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the mackenzie river delta in canada 's western arctic with an initial capacity to transport N billion cubic feet of gas daily 
 industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between transcanada which has a monopoly on canadian gas transportation east of alberta and <unk> and <unk> which control the pipelines within and running west of alberta respectively 
 this is virgin territory <unk> and it 's going to be nasty said one <unk> who asked not to be named 
 neither is going to back down easily 
 transcanada declined to comment on the foothills application 
 but last week gerald <unk> president and chief executive officer of transcanada said the company intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role 
 a number of issues still need to be resolved before canadian regulators give any project the final <unk> 
 first the price of natural gas will have to almost double 
 kent <unk> president of foothills said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach us$ N a thousand cubic feet by N in current dollars up from a current spot price of about us$ N 
 mr. <unk> 's us$ N estimate is somewhat below the $ N floor price that calgary-based consulting firm paul <unk> & co. recently said would be needed for mackenzie delta gas producers to see a return on their investment 
 u.s. gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for mackenzie delta gas or develop alaskan reserves in the <unk> bay area first a project that has been on hold for more than a decade 
 robert <unk> chairman and chief executive of foothills said it 's too early to say whether alaskan or mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first 
 but foothills said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line the alaska natural gas transportation system further north toward alaska 
 if that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting mackenzie delta reserves to the alaska <unk> 
 it 's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects 
 douglas <unk> vice president of shell canada noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would <unk> the regulatory review process and <unk> down development 
 <unk> pipe line co. an oil pipeline operator rumored to be <unk> a gas pipeline proposal of its own said that is n't in the cards 
 instead richard <unk> president and chief executive of <unk> 's calgary-based parent <unk> energy inc. said the company would prefer to work with other interested parties on a joint proposal 
 as for foothills ' <unk> bid mr. <unk> said if they think it gives them some kind of priority position well that 's their strategy 
 the federal reserve board said it is delaying approval of first union corp. 's proposed $ N million acquisition of florida national banks of florida inc. pending the outcome of an examination into first union 's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods 
 the decision reflects the fed 's tougher stance on <unk> the community reinvestment act a federal law passed in N to help low-income residents obtain loans 
 in recent years unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make <unk> loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the fed about reinvestment act compliance 
 few <unk> however have actually delayed or <unk> mergers 
 the current dispute involves allegations that charlotte <unk> first union has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act 
 during the summer legal services corp. a florida legal aid group filed a petition with the fed on behalf of residents in four florida counties 
 the petition challenged first union 's lending record in the state saying that the bank-holding company had shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is <unk> almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state 
 in deferring action on the merger the fed said the board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow it to reach a final conclusion on first union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in florida and north carolina including low to <unk> neighborhoods in those communities 
 the fed said the comptroller of the currency is expected to begin a community reinvestment act examination of first union 's florida and north carolina banking units in the next two weeks 
 first union with assets of about $ N billion said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities 
 the bank added that it believes the review will demonstrate that first union is in compliance with the requirements of the community reinvestment act 
 the company has already missed its initial oct. N target date for completing the merger 
 it said yesterday it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in N 
 florida national if acquired would almost double first union 's banking franchise in florida to $ N billion in assets 
 that would make it the second-largest bank after barnett banks inc. in a state widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the country 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday first union shares rose N cents to $ N 
 florida national stock closed unchanged at $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 earlier this year the fed denied an application by continental bank corp. to purchase grand <unk> state bank in <unk> ariz. on grounds that continental had n't fully <unk> with the community reinvestment act 
 at the time the fed said the <unk> the first ever on such grounds signaled the agency 's new emphasis on the community reinvestment act 
 eastern airlines ' creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans according to sources familiar with the committee 
 in a meeting in new york yesterday the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for eastern 's future the sources said 
 the consultants had been working to finish a report this week 
 that means eastern a unit of texas air corp. of houston can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee 
 the committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan 
 in another development yesterday creditors were told that $ N million they had expected to become available for <unk> a reorganization may not <unk> according to one source 
 texas air has run into difficulty <unk> about $ N million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market the person said 
 and plans to raise another $ N million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a <unk> the source said 
 an eastern spokesman said the $ N million will have no effect <unk> on the asset structure of eastern 's plan 
 <unk> million in the total scheme of things is not that significant 
 it is unclear what caused the creditors to do an <unk> on exploring alternatives to eastern 's new reorganization plan 
 however since eastern first filed for chapter N protection march N it has consistently promised to pay creditors N cents on the dollar 
 because the carrier is still <unk> to do that some committee members successfully argued that there 's little reason yet to explore a different plan according to one person familiar with the creditors ' position 
 earlier this month the accounting firm of ernst & young and the securities firm of goldman sachs & co. the experts hired by the creditors contended that eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting 
 ernst & young said eastern 's plan would miss projections by $ N million 
 goldman said eastern would miss the same mark by at least $ N million 
 the consultants maintained eastern would n't generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan 
 eastern at the time disputed those <unk> and called the experts ' report completely off base 
 yesterday joel <unk> an attorney for eastern 's creditors committee declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to 
 he said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating 
 in every case people would like to see a <unk> plan he said 
 eastern and its creditors agreed in july on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $ N billion in assets and to emerge from chapter N status in late N at two-thirds its former size 
 eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk its south american routes which were valued at $ N million 
 such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid and the two sides had to begin negotiating again 
 eastern has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from chapter N proceedings early next year operating more flights than it originally had scheduled

 west german insurance giant allianz ag entered the takeover battle between france 's cie financiere de paribas and cie. de navigation mixte 
 allianz said it won french government approval to buy as much as one-third of navigation mixte a diversified financial transport and food holding company 
 the move comes a week after paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for N N control of navigation mixte 
 <unk> allianz 's brief <unk> statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of navigation mixte 
 that would be a blow to both paribas and navigation mixte 
 each had claimed allianz europe 's largest insurance company as a <unk> ally 
 the allianz statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one 
 it led to broad market speculation that paribas now will <unk> its bid which is expected to be formally launched later this week after approval from french government regulators 
 allianz 's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of west german companies looking ahead to the reduction in european community internal barriers in N to get involved in what until now were considered internal french affairs 
 deutsche bank dresdner bank and commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to expand in france before N 
 dresdner bank this month moved to acquire banque <unk> des <unk> a small french merchant bank that deutsche bank had looked at and passed over 
 commerzbank had hoped to buy a stake in credit lyonnais until the <unk> returned to government last year and canceled plans to <unk> the large french bank 
 deutsche bank has actively sought a french acquisition for at least two years 
 lately analysts say deutsche bank has shocked some in the french financial community by indicating it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches 
 we are still looking said a deutsche bank spokesman 
 the banks we think would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale though deutsche bank would be able to pay a good price 
 while allianz officials were n't willing to comment in any detail on their plans they said allianz currently holds between N N and N N of navigation mixte an apparent increase from the N N stake that navigation mixte officials had earlier announced 
 paris market sources said they believed allianz was buying yesterday morning and navigation mixte moved up N francs $ N to close at N francs in heavy trading 
 it was the first day of trading following the suspension of navigation mixte shares last monday when paribas announced its plan to pay N francs for each navigation mixte share 
 allianz also holds a N N stake in navigation mixte 's insurance subsidiary one of france 's largest insurance groups which it bought for about N billion francs just before paribas launched its bid 
 navigation mixte holds the remaining N N 
 allianz said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest which ties it to navigation mixte as a partner 
 allianz 's statement stressed the company 's previously announced position that paribas 's offer price is too low 
 allianz also suggested without saying so directly that it regrets that paribas is n't bidding for all of navigation mixte 's shares 
 the problem here analysts say is that if paribas wins its N N remaining navigation mixte shares will fall in value 
 that <unk> many current holders such as allianz which could n't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to paribas 
 the allianz statement led to speculation that allianz eventually could sell to paribas 
 that would be bad news for navigation mixte 's current management which was counting on allianz to help fend off paribas 
 allianz did n't say whom if anyone it will support 
 it said simply that it will boost its navigation mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself as long as it has french regulatory officials ' approval 
 paribas currently intends to offer N francs a share for navigation mixte shares that receive full dividends this year 
 it is to offer N francs for shares created on july N which receive partial dividends 
 alternatively it would offer to swap three paribas shares for one navigation mixte share 
 paribas already holds about N N of navigation mixte and the acquisition of the additional N N would cost it about N billion francs under its current bid 
 the bid values navigation mixte at around N billion francs depending on how many holders of navigation mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires

 the new york times co. said it reached a settlement with independent home delivery dealers in the metropolitan new york area that will free the newspaper to expand home delivery circulation

 singer <unk> midler won a $ N federal court jury verdict against young & rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using <unk> performers to <unk> products 
 the decision in los angeles federal court stems from a N mercury <unk> tv ad that young & rubicam worked up for ford motor co 
 the ad agency had approached ms. midler about appearing but she declined citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work 
 the agency then turned to a former backup singer for ms. midler who appeared in the ad and <unk> what was generally considered a more than credible <unk> of ms. midler 's N hit song do you <unk> dance 
 the appeals court held when a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately <unk> in order to sell a product the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs 
 the judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold ford liable in the case 
 in a statement young & rubicam called the award unfortunate but <unk> 
 peter <unk> a los angeles lawyer for ms. midler said we believe that the verdict <unk> her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with <unk> <unk> the voices of well-known performers 
 that is a property right that belongs to the performer 
 the award although far less than the $ N million including punitive damages that ms. midler sought is likely to force madison avenue to further <unk> how they use famous <unk> in ads 
 last year 's appeals court decision for instance spawned several suits reportedly including a recent action by the <unk> of singer bobby <unk> against mcdonald 's corp. over its mac tonight tv commercials a rough <unk> of mr. <unk> 's mack the <unk> trademark

 ms. <unk> sued over the use of her these <unk> are made for <unk> song in the ad 
 at that time the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law which has always <unk> down on the unauthorized copying of <unk> and musical <unk> but never actual performances

 mrs. thatcher 's remarks were seen as a <unk> to several leading members of her own conservative party who have called for a more <unk> british commitment to the ems 
 at the same time a recent poll shows that mrs. thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any british leader since <unk> began N years ago

 according to one london-based analyst even higher interest rates wo n't help the pound if britain 's government continues to appear unstable

 japanese companies have long been accused of <unk> profit to boost sales 
 but fujitsu ltd. has taken that practice to a new extreme 
 japan 's biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a <unk> system for the city of hiroshima 's waterworks 
 its bid one yen or less than a u.s. penny 
 the bid created such a furor that fujitsu said it is now offering to withdraw from the project 
 from a <unk> viewpoint it was not <unk> acceptable a fujitsu spokeswoman said yesterday 
 hiroshima city officials could n't be reached to find out whether they would drop fujitsu 's bid 
 fujitsu said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market 
 we desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field the fujitsu spokeswoman said 
 we expect a big market in the future so in the long term it will be profitable 
 it 's a kind of an investment 
 hiroshima 's waterworks bureau said the municipal government had <unk> about N million yen $ N for the project 
 i was <unk> <unk> <unk> head of the bureau was quoted by <unk> news service as saying 
 i understand the firm 's enthusiasm in getting the deal but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion 
 indeed fujitsu officials admitted they may have been a little <unk> 
 the fujitsu spokeswoman said <unk> officials did n't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing does n't happen in the future 
 it 's contrary to common sense she added 
 specifically fujitsu won the right to design the specifications for a computerized system that will show water lines throughout the city 
 the system could be used in a fire or earthquake to <unk> problems among other things 
 a waterworks official said fujitsu will have to design the system so it would be compatible with other makers ' equipment 
 but industry officials expressed concern that the initial project might give fujitsu an edge in winning more lucrative contracts later 
 fujitsu said it hopes the hiroshima contract will help it secure <unk> with other municipalities 
 japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue 
 in the near future it will be a big market not just for waterworks but for all <unk> systems the fujitsu spokeswoman said 
 we can expect a <unk> market 
 no foreign companies bid on the hiroshima project according to the bureau 
 but the japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited by americans as a classic barrier to entry in japan 's market

 fujitsu was n't the only company willing to sacrifice profit on the project

 georgia-pacific corp. offered to acquire great northern nekoosa corp. for $ N a share or about $ N billion 
 the offer capped a week of rumors that georgia-pacific an atlanta-based forest-products company was considering making a bid for nekoosa a <unk> concern based in <unk> conn 
 executives at nekoosa could n't be reached and officials at georgia pacific declined to comment 
 analysts however were surprised because the tender offer appeared unsolicited 
 it 's quite a <unk> said one adding that the offer could spark a period of industry consolidation 
 the two companies would appear to be a logical fit because of their <unk> lines and analysts described the offer representing a N N premium over nekoosa 's market price as fair 
 nekoosa closed yesterday at $ N up $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 but industry observers still questioned whether georgia pacific will ultimately prevail 
 you have to watch out for <unk> said one analyst 
 international paper or weyerhaeuser could step in 
 the bid for great northern a notice of which appears in an <unk> in today 's wall street journal is the first big takeover offer since the collapse of a $ N billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. oct. N 
 that collapse following on the heels of disarray in the market for high-risk high-yield bonds cast doubt on the entire takeover business which has fueled both big profits among wall street securities firms and big gains in the stock market generally 
 while georgia-pacific 's stock has outperformed the market in the past two years nekoosa has lagged the market in the same period 
 yesterday 's rise in nekoosa 's share price came on volume of N shares four times the daily average 
 according to dow jones professional investor report options trading in nekoosa was also heavy ranking only behind international business machines corp. and ual in volume on the chicago board options exchange 
 according to the value line investment survey demand for nekoosa 's commodity paper has weakened prompting earnings to decline by N N in the third quarter ended sept. N 
 value line added with discounts widening on business papers and with newsprint and <unk> shipments flat we expect negative earnings comparisons through next year 
 by contrast value line said georgia-pacific is in a <unk> good position to deal with weakening paper markets because its production is concentrated not in the northwest but in the south where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising <unk> prices 
 also it is n't exposed to the weakening newsprint business and is strong in the <unk> tissue business 
 the purchase of nekoosa would easily <unk> georgia-pacific 's $ N million acquisition of <unk> pulp & paper co. last year

 for the sixth time in as many years continental airlines has a new senior executive 
 gone is d. joseph corr the airline 's chairman chief executive and president appointed only last december 
 mr. corr resigned to pursue other business interests the airline said 
 he could not be reached for comment 
 succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be frank lorenzo chairman and chief executive of continental 's parent texas air corp 
 mr. lorenzo N years old is <unk> the job that was his before mr. corr signed on 
 the airline also named <unk> <unk> as president 
 mr. <unk> N is a <unk> veteran of texas air and texas international airlines its predecessor 
 most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at texas air 
 top executives at continental have n't lasted long especially those recruited from outside 
 but mr. corr 's tenure was shorter than most 
 the <unk> mr. corr was hired largely because he was credited with returning trans world airlines inc. to profitability while he was its president from N to N 
 before that he was an executive with a manufacturing concern 
 at continental he cut money-losing operations which helped produce a modest profit in this year 's second quarter 
 but mr. corr a <unk> pilot in his spare time was understood to be frustrated by what he regarded as limited freedom under mr. lorenzo 
 while not officially an executive at continental during mr. corr 's tenure mr. lorenzo is known for keeping close <unk> on texas air 's operating units 
 continental is texas air 's flagship and was built painfully to its present size under mr. lorenzo after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in N 
 it 's unclear what role if any mr. lorenzo 's recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in continental had in mr. corr 's departure 
 one source familiar with the airline said however that mr. corr was n't informed in advance during the summer when mr. lorenzo began discussions with potential buyers 
 during his tenure mr. corr attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company 's future plans traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier 's image 
 mr. <unk> is one of a handful of executives mr. lorenzo has relied on over the years 
 previously he had served in financial planning positions at the company 's eastern airlines unit 
 another longtime ally phil <unk> currently heads eastern now in chapter N bankruptcy proceedings 
 mr. <unk> previously had a turn at running continental 
 among the other <unk> are stephen wolf now chairman of ual inc. and thomas <unk> president of pan am corp

 the summer crop is <unk> winter <unk> has yet to begin 
 farmers in loose <unk> and fancy <unk> spend their <unk> laughing and <unk> at the markets 
 one could imagine such a <unk> in the lives of the arabs before the <unk> of oil prices 
 for just as the arabs were in the 1960s the farmers of sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame 
 the arabs had merely oil 
 these farmers may have a grip on the world 's very heart 
 or at least its heart disease 
 that is because sidhpur has a <unk> on the world 's supply of <unk> seed also known as <unk> <unk> or in western <unk> psyllium a tiny <unk> <unk> seed that according to early research may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood 
 ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed americans have begun <unk> up psyllium in their breakfast <unk> 
 if further research proves the seed 's benefits this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a <unk> fad to rival all <unk> since <unk> oil 
 this seed 's not grown anywhere else in india or anywhere else in the world says <unk> <unk> a vice president of procter & gamble india ltd. a major psyllium buyer and <unk> 
 the proper <unk> conditions do n't exist in many places in the world 
 <unk> patel a <unk> and exporter of the seed <unk> if psyllium takes the place of oat bran it will be huge 
 whether psyllium makes sidhpur 's fortune depends on <unk> americans the u.s. food and drug administration and of course the outcome of further research 
 only one thing is certain here <unk> is likely to remain solely an export item from sidhpur for a long time 
 local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as <unk> or <unk> a <unk> 
 but they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning and perhaps little need lean <unk> <unk> the farmers are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> world of cholesterol 
 psyllium is an annual <unk> <unk> <unk> that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here mainly as a <unk> and <unk> 
 as such the <unk> fiber has an almost <unk> following in northern india 
 i can assure you <unk> a <unk> lawyer in new <unk> with a <unk> raised <unk> from personal experience it works 
 a prominent businessman in <unk> gives a similar <unk> i have been taking it daily since N 
 folk doctors also <unk> it for kidney <unk> and <unk> problems <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 some apply it to <unk> <unk> 
 the plant has a <unk> stem that produces flowers and <unk> seeds 
 it is the seed 's <unk> and size N of them weigh only N <unk> or about as much as two paper <unk> that explain the historical <unk> to <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> of the seed is removed <unk> and crushed the seed itself is fed to animals 
 some N N of the crop which was worth $ N million last year is exported 
 for decades psyllium <unk> has been the main <unk> in such <unk> as procter & gamble co. 's <unk> the <unk> brand in the u.s. and ciba-geigy corp. 's <unk> 
 but some time ago researchers discovered that <unk> fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood 
 <unk> p&g took an interest it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol 
 one of the studies done at the university of minnesota tested N people with raised cholesterol levels 
 after N weeks the group that took three daily <unk> of <unk> saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels and an even larger reduction in levels of <unk> <unk> the so-called bad cholesterol 
 in late N p&g asked the fda for approval to market <unk> as the first <unk> <unk> product in the 
 in april the psyllium <unk> got more crowded 
 general mills inc. the food giant launched a breakfast cereal called benefit containing psyllium oat wheat and <unk> bran the words reduce cholesterol were <unk> displayed on its package 
 in september kellogg co. launched a competing <unk> cereal called <unk> 
 suddenly on television in advertisements and on their cereal boxes americans were <unk> with news about the <unk> seed 
 the flood of claims and <unk> worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new <unk> 
 this month the food and drug administration expressed concern that americans might someday in various forms <unk> too much psyllium 
 currently there is a <unk> in the psyllium war 
 the fda has asked kellogg and general mills to show research that their <unk> are safe 
 it also ordered p&g to produce more studies to <unk> its claims that <unk> can lower cholesterol 
 but the agency has n't <unk> psyllium off store shelves 
 if the fda approves the new uses of psyllium other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products 
 it 's going to be a <unk> thing says mr. <unk> of p&g in <unk> 
 says psyllium exporter mr. patel i just got back yesterday from the u.s. 
 in the newspapers on the radio and tv psyllium is everywhere 
 but the news of the boom has yet to <unk> down to the farmers 
 they only know of one use for the crop as a <unk> and with psyllium prices currently <unk> in the wake of a <unk> crop they think of the seed as a marginal crop something to grow between summer wheat crops 
 psyllium 's not a good crop complains <unk> <unk> a <unk> farmer from the village of <unk> 
 you get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is <unk> 
 even at the basic chemicals pharmaceuticals and cosmetics export promotion council the government agency that <unk> the seed the psyllium boom is distant <unk> 
 the staff <unk> about psyllium 's hefty contribution to american <unk> without quite <unk> the implications of the research on cholesterol 
 the council 's annual report has psyllium on its last page <unk> with such <unk> export items as <unk> and <unk> <unk> a plant that <unk> <unk> 
 in one way the psyllium middlemen the buyers and exporters are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves 
 they want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year 
 but there 's a catch 
 sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities 
 this is partly due to the particular demands of the crop 
 psyllium needs <unk> soil <unk> during the first few weeks and then total <unk> when its seeds are maturing 
 small crops are grown in pakistan france spain italy belgium and brazil but their quality ca n't compare to that of indian psyllium 
 big buyers like procter & gamble say there are other spots on the globe and in india where the seed could be grown 
 it 's not a crop that ca n't be doubled or tripled says mr. <unk> 
 but no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop 
 in sidhpur it is almost time to <unk> this year 's crop 
 many farmers too removed to <unk> psyllium 's new <unk> in the west have decided to plant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> seeds 
 mr. <unk> is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as <unk> or <unk> 
 maybe i 'll plant <unk> seeds 
 his brother <unk> whose head is <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vigorous <unk> 
 so when next year 's psyllium crop is <unk> in march it may be smaller than the N metric tons of the past few years right at the crest of the psyllium boom

 small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true <unk> rates for <unk> insurance initially at least 
 but then they wake up to a nightmare 
 the reasonable <unk> rates can be followed by increases of N N or more if a covered employee files a major claim they complain 
 insurance premiums for one small maryland concern went up N N in less than two years the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a <unk> disk 
 there 's a distinct possibility that i may lose my job over this the employee karen allen of floor covering resources <unk> md. recently told a congressional hearing 
 she said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her <unk> 
 for employee and employer alike the worry is widespread 
 surveys repeatedly show that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns 
 the house energy and commerce committee 's health subcommittee headed by democratic rep. henry waxman of california is looking into complaints that small businesses not only ca n't keep reasonably priced <unk> insurance if claims are filed but often ca n't get coverage at all if a worker is termed <unk> <unk> 
 i have an old-fashioned name for people in that position sick people who need health insurance rep. waxman says 
 what we 're seeing now makes a <unk> of the idea of insurance collect premiums from the healthy dump the sick and let them pay their own bills 
 some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies 
 the concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market 
 as larger companies increasingly <unk> or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills the insurance industry has turned to the <unk> market that was once a <unk> for them 
 insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick but it 's a roll of the <unk> says <unk> <unk> of the small business service bureau a group representing N small businesses nationwide 
 one case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick <unk> and rates go up N N to N N 
 small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness 
 in addition the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild <unk> condition to psychological counseling after a <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 the health insurance association of america an insurers ' trade group acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has <unk> the problem in the small-business market 
 but it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care 
 some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market 
 they say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do 
 but the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums

 you ca n't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace 
 rep. waxman and democratic sen. edward kennedy of massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem 
 the proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the <unk> problems 
 but small-business lobbyists say they support the idea included in the <unk> bill of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating which <unk> rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only <unk> small companies as clients 
 but first on the list of priorities says the national federation of independent business is to prohibit state laws requiring the <unk> of specialty items such as psychiatric care in basic health plans 
 such requirements they argue make it difficult to provide a basic low-cost <unk> package 
 before the state of wisconsin mandated that <unk> care be covered there were only N <unk> <unk> in the state now there are N says <unk> miller an <unk> lobbyist 
 she contends that similar <unk> have driven up insurance costs N N in maryland and N N in california 
 the <unk> association also strongly <unk> with the proposed community rating which does n't save one dollar argues james <unk> <unk> 's washington counsel 
 it just makes healthy businesses subsidize <unk> ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy 
 mr. <unk> says the <unk> is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism to help cover small groups that ca n't get insurance without excluding certain employees

 today with business activity in hong kong staggering along at an <unk> pace the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear 
 manufacturers have survived the turmoil in china largely <unk> 
 signs of revival seem evident in hong kong 's <unk> hotel sector 
 but in the stock and real-estate markets activity remains <unk> even though prices have regained much of their lost ground 
 <unk> demand reported by <unk> retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt 
 as many economists and businessmen see it those <unk> underscore a <unk> that seems likely to <unk> the economy throughout the 1990s 
 that <unk> is hong kong 's economically rewarding yet politically <unk> relationship with china 
 as a model of capitalist efficiency on southern china 's <unk> hong kong 's prospects look good 
 china 's land and labor offer <unk> alternatives to local industry 
 <unk> freight <unk> through the territory 's port 
 in the decade since the communist nation emerged from <unk> its <unk> trade with the west has lifted hong kong 's status as a regional business center 
 these benefits seem secure despite china 's current economic and political troubles 
 but to hong kong china is n't <unk> business 
 it is also the <unk> power that come N will take over this british colony 
 china 's leaders have promised generous <unk> for <unk> hong kong 
 that promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on marxist <unk> and <unk> force to crush their nation 's democracy movement 
 outflows of people and capital from hong kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s 
 a widely held assumption all along has been that given its robust economy hong kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to <unk> offset the outflows 
 with interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since june N that assumption no longer seems so safe 
 investment and emigration plans take time to come to <unk> 
 only four months have passed since the beijing massacre and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact 
 the only consensus is that more money and people may leave hong kong than had been thought likely 
 this expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects 
 the question as many people see it is how long such uncertainty will last 
 <unk> fraser an economist with <unk> carr a subsidiary of france 's banque <unk> believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after N 
 it may experience an <unk> or two in between 
 but with local investors shaken by china 's political and economic turmoil she says a genuine recovery may not arrive until hong kong can prove itself secure under chinese sovereignty 
 investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the <unk> to N she says 
 over the next few years i would advise caution 
 in a <unk> published book on the territory a political economist <unk> <unk> has derived three future scenarios from interviews with N hong kong government officials and businessmen 
 nearly half of them argue that hong kong 's uneasy relationship with china will <unk> though not inhibit long-term economic growth 
 the rest are split roughly between <unk> who expect hong kong to <unk> along as before and <unk> who <unk> <unk> chaos 
 the interviews took place two years ago 
 since the china crisis erupted mr. <unk> says the scenario as <unk> by the <unk> group bears a remarkable <unk> to the difficulties hong kong currently faces 
 the consensus of this group which he <unk> <unk> is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between N N and N N 
 such a pace of growth though respectable for mature industrialized economies would be unusually slow for hong kong 
 only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below N N for two or more consecutive years 
 the first instance occurred in N when china 's cultural revolution triggered bloody street <unk> in the colony 
 the other came in N from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash 
 during the past N years hong kong 's economic growth has averaged N N annually 
 given hong kong 's record mr. <unk> 's <unk> might have sounded <unk> conservative when the interviews took place two years ago 
 under the current circumstances he says their scenario no longer seems <unk> 
 the city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor 
 it could lose some of its <unk> says mr. <unk> a director of baring securities hong kong ltd. a unit of britain 's <unk> plc 
 it does n't have to be a disaster 
 it just means that hong kong would become a less exciting place 
 going by official forecasts of <unk> which measures the colony 's output of goods and services minus foreign income mr. <unk> 's <unk> seem relatively close to the mark 
 after taking into account the fallout from the china crisis the government has projected N <unk> growth of N N 
 the <unk> forecast published aug. N compares with an earlier forecast of N N published march N and a N N rate achieved in 
 sir <unk> jacobs hong kong 's financial secretary says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally 
 we are n't looking at anything like a <unk> scenario he says 
 but clearly we 're entering a difficult period 
 many factors besides a <unk> of N will have a bearing on hong kong 's economy 
 one concerns japanese investors 
 barely visible on hong kong 's property scene in N by last year japan had become the top foreign investor spending $ N million 
 the market has grown relatively quiet since the china crisis 
 but if the japanese return in force their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors ' <unk> commitment 
 another and critical factor is the u.s. hong kong 's biggest export market 
 even before the china crisis weak u.s. demand was slowing local economic growth 
 <unk> strong consumer spending in the u.s. two years ago helped <unk> the local economy at more than twice its current rate 
 indeed a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern hong kong 's economic <unk> 
 once external conditions such as u.s. demand swing in the territory 's favor they argue local businessmen will probably overcome their N worries and continue doing business as usual 
 but economic arguments however solid wo n't necessarily <unk> hong kong 's N million people 
 many are refugees having fled china 's <unk> cycles of political repression and poverty since the communist party took power in N 
 as a result many of those now planning to leave hong kong ca n't easily be <unk> by <unk> improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate 
 emigration applications soared in N when britain and china ratified their accord on hong kong 's future 
 in N hong kong 's most <unk> year for a decade N left up N N from the previous year 
 last year N went 
 the government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as N a projection that is widely regarded as <unk> low 
 a large number of those leaving are managers and professionals 
 while no one <unk> to know the exact cost of such a brain drain to the economy hardly anyone doubts that it <unk> a threat 
 when the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members economic growth is bound to be affected says <unk> <unk> an economist with hang seng bank 
 while wall street is retreating from computer-driven program trading big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast further <unk> the stock market trading executives say 
 <unk> to a mounting public outcry three more major securities firms bear stearns & co. inc. morgan stanley & co. and oppenheimer & co. announced friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts 
 painewebber group inc. announced a <unk> on thursday from stock-index arbitrage a controversial program-trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock-market swings 
 though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility most wall street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers 
 trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds which <unk> wall street firms in terms of the size of their program trades will continue to launch big programs through the stock market 
 wells fargo investment advisers bankers trust co. and mellon capital management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of wall street trading executives say 
 these huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the s&p N stock index or other stock indexes and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits 
 they will do it every chance they get said one program-trading executive 
 consequently abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon they say 
 in fact without wall street firms trading for their own accounts the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant 
 more customers may come to us now said james <unk> president of bear stearns <unk> 
 executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the N crash 
 they noted that studies completed after the N crash <unk> program trading as a source of volatility 
 the issues that are now being raised in classic <unk> fashion fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies said fred <unk> chairman of wells fargo investment advisers 
 a bankers trust spokesman said that the company 's investment arm uses stock-index arbitrage to enhance investors ' returns 
 officials at mellon capital were unavailable for comment 
 stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole 
 many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the <unk> 's returns 
 some stock-index funds are huge 
 wells fargo investment advisers for example managed $ N billion in stock investments tracking the s&p N at the end of june according to standard & poor 's corp 
 mr. <unk> said $ N billion of that is used in active index arbitrage 
 stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences 
 the 190-point plunge in the stock market oct. N has heightened concerns about volatility 
 and while signs of an economic slowdown softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market 's recent weakness many investors rushed to blame program trading for <unk> market swings 
 the wall street firms ' <unk> followed their recent <unk> by several institutional investors 
 last tuesday kemper corp. 's kemper financial services inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on friday 
 phoenix mutual life insurance co. and <unk> asset management inc. also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading 
 though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers morgan stanley 's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as kidder peabody & co. that still do such trades for their own account 
 morgan stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months 
 indeed morgan stanley 's president richard b. fisher said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially <unk> stock-market volatility 
 we have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating <unk> volatility mr. fisher said 
 there is no question that investor confidence in the stock market is critical 
 joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action merrill lynch & co. recommended program-trading reforms late friday including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination 
 separately mr. <unk> of bear stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to enhance <unk> 
 margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security 
 current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks 
 some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility 
 these rules they say permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks which frequently <unk> the two markets out of line 
 stock-index arbitrage because it sells the more expensive market and buys the cheaper one attempts to <unk> the link between the stock and futures markets and the adjustments are often abrupt 
 but <unk> trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks which invites frequent <unk> of stock-index arbitrage in the first place 
 there has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis said christopher <unk> director of trading at <unk> securities corp 
 one agency should have the authority over all equity products 
 like so many trends in the entertainment industry the current spate of rape <unk> on television seems to represent a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> 
 the former comes from the latest wave of political <unk> in hollywood especially around <unk> issues such as abortion 
 the latter comes from the perception on the part of many people in network tv that their only hope of keeping viewers from <unk> to cable is to fill the <unk> with an increasingly raw <unk> 
 put these together and you get programs about rape 
 the best of the crop was last week 's season premiere of in the heat of the night the nbc series based on a N feature film about a black philadelphia police <unk> in a small southern town 
 in the series <unk> <unk> howard <unk> and his wife <unk> <unk> johnson have settled in <unk> miss 
 because the show has acquired a sense of place by being <unk> on location in georgia this episode in which <unk> gets <unk> by an arrogant white <unk> does a decent job of <unk> the social <unk> of the crime 
 obviously it 's harder to establish a sense of place in a <unk> tv movie 
 but tonight 's offering settle the score N p.m. est on nbc does n't even try 
 this tale of a chicago <unk> returning home to find the man who <unk> her N years earlier is supposed to be set in the <unk> 
 but it 's more like an illustration of what ben stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the tv industry fear of violence and <unk> because of race or <unk> fear and lack of <unk> about the politics of small-town people produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of tv writers and producers 
 the writer and executive producer of settle the score steve sohmer is a graduate of yale who participated in a pbs <unk> aired this summer in which six members of the yale class of N <unk> about their lives since <unk> 
 at one point in the <unk> mr. sohmer who is jewish says he felt rejected by many of the <unk> and <unk> he met at yale 
 he quotes one student saying you 're just the kind of <unk> we <unk> ca n't stand 
 mr. sohmer <unk> that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now a <unk> on one of the two islands off the coast of america 
 but is <unk> in hollywood enough 
 not to judge by settle the score in which mr. sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own 
 of all the <unk> <unk> of small-town america i 've seen on tv this film is the most <unk> nasty 
 the sole sympathetic character is the <unk> daughter kate <unk> smith and she is <unk> only by virtue of having nothing in common with her <unk> a truly <unk> pack of southern <unk> whose grim existence consists mostly of growing <unk> and <unk> sex 
 i mean these folks are so <unk> that they blame pretty kate for the fact that when she was a <unk> someone tied her hands behind her back thrust her head into a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and beat her and then left her to die in a <unk> room 
 her pa howard duff is the kind of guy who while saying grace at the <unk> table <unk> at the word <unk> and <unk> at the daughter he has n't seen for two decades because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the <unk> room and has been <unk> the same taste ever since in the <unk> of chicago 
 people like pa do exist of course 
 but in mr. sohmer 's <unk> he is but the tip of the <unk> <unk> 
 every man kate <unk> is either <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or all three 
 add the fact that any one of them including pa could be her <unk> and you have a setting that does n't resemble small-town america or even hollywood 's nightmare of small-town america so much as a <unk> <unk> <unk> like margaret <unk> 's the <unk> 's tale itself soon to be you <unk> it a hollywood movie 
 there are two exceptions <unk> jeffrey <unk> the local doctor who has always loved kate and lincoln richard <unk> kate 's <unk> but <unk> brother 
 <unk> makes <unk> passes at kate when she 's <unk> with anger and fear but we know from the outset that he 's not a member of the evil <unk> 
 how could he be 
 he 's the director of the local planned <unk> chapter 
 as for lincoln if you ca n't guess why he 's so sweet to his sister when everybody else <unk> her then i 'm not going to tell you 
 as for the women they 're <unk> 
 kate 's <unk> <unk> <unk> is a moral <unk> 
 her <unk> <unk> wright is a <unk> <unk> afraid that kate will <unk> all the married men in town including a particularly <unk> fellow named tucker whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home <unk> to her <unk> and cigarette burns while he <unk> kate into a dance that consists of <unk> on her while trying to break her <unk> 
 at the very least it would appear that <unk> is a poor judge of <unk> <unk> 
 yet even these <unk> <unk> are not as bad as the moral <unk> at the heart of settle the score 
 in the <unk> episode of in the heat of the night we saw <unk> being attacked but we were n't invited to enjoy the <unk> 
 in mr. sohmer 's film by contrast we are urged to share the <unk> excitement of the <unk> creeping up on his victim as the camera <unk> kate in various stages of <unk> and <unk> on the sight of her <unk> body during frequent <unk> to the rape 
 at this point the truce between <unk> and <unk> gets mighty uneasy 
 take the scene in which kate stands naked by a <unk> window <unk> to her hidden <unk> look all you want 
 starting tomorrow i 'm <unk> you 
 or the one in which she and <unk> are <unk> in the city and after insisting on separate motel rooms she <unk> on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape wearing nothing but a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> 
 surely the question is obvious 
 with friends like mr. sohmer do the <unk> of hollywood need enemies

 he added that final guidelines to be published in early november will determine whether the bank is in compliance 
 crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and <unk> a financial restructuring plan 
 it would n't identify the bankers 
 additionally crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ N million or $ N a share compared with net income of $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 a major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $ N million of goodwill 
 the spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused crossland to revise its business objectives and consequently to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions 
 crossland recorded an additional $ N million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter 
 net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ N million from $ N million a year ago

 <unk> a show about a black ad executive who gives up the <unk> for a <unk> classroom is <unk> the ratings test 
 so producers <unk> and <unk> <unk> spun their <unk> and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign 
 by wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring <unk> 
 using direct mail for a tv show is like fishing for <unk> with a <unk> hook 
 it just is n't done 
 but <unk> this kind of <unk> plea to black <unk> makes it even more unusual 
 still mr. <unk> thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three <unk> black homes he needs by mailing to the almost N blacks who form what he calls the <unk> 
 the <unk> is n't organized but you and i know it exists says mr. <unk> referring to the often <unk> small world of black professionals and community leaders

 i want white america to talk about it too but i 'm convinced that the <unk> is what 's happening 
 abc says it is aware of the producers ' action but the mailing was sent without the network 's blessing

 having more than a <unk> presence here should enhance communications and business relationships mr. <unk> said 
 since the cost of <unk> gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it it helps to have input and access to transportation companies 
 the move which could cost transcanada as much as N million canadian dollars us$ N million in relocation and severance payments should be complete by next summer mr. <unk> said 
 all N toronto-based employees will be offered positions in calgary the company said 
 the company will save between c$ N million and c$ N million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to calgary mr. <unk> added

 if it <unk> fashion too much the shop risks <unk> its <unk> customers by <unk> value it risks <unk> down its <unk> <unk> 
 fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant <unk> in its women 's business given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline

 with newly installed <unk> the store retains its signature <unk> look but is less <unk> 
 more shirts and <unk> will be laid out on tables instead of sitting behind glass cases so that customers can walk up and touch them mr. roberti says 
 because the biggest growth in <unk> is in casual <unk> brooks brothers is chasing more of that business 
 the entire second floor of its madison avenue store is now casual <unk> featuring items such as ski <unk> leather <unk> and a $ N <unk> baseball hat with the store 's crest 
 the centerpiece of the overhaul according to mr. roberti is the men 's tailored clothing department where brooks brothers has added new suit styles and <unk> 
 the perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit mr. roberti says referring to brooks brothers ' signature <unk> <unk> suit with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> fit 
 but it now offers more <unk> versions and suits with a <unk> fit 
 it also plans to add suits cut for athletic men with broader upper bodies

 arthur price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of mtm entertainment inc. a los angeles production company that has fallen on hard times 
 mr. price N years old also stepped down from the board of tvs entertainment plc the british tv company that last year bought mtm producer of such tv programs as hill street blues and the mary tyler moore show 
 a tvs spokesman said he did n't know mr. price 's plans 
 james gatward tvs 's chief executive said in a statement that he will assume overall responsibility for mtm 's operations until a successor is named 
 industry analysts speculated that mr. price 's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with mr. gatward 
 mr. price wanted to run the mtm business and may have <unk> selling the company to tvs suggested charles <unk> managing director of zenith productions a subsidiary of <unk> communications plc london 
 mr. gatward declined to comment and mr. price could n't be reached on friday 
 in the tvs statement mr. price said leaving mtm was a very difficult decision but added that it is now time for a change 
 the $ N million purchase of mtm represented an <unk> international move for tvs which then was about half the u.s. concern 's size 
 at the time mr. gatward said his friendship with mr. price had <unk> the way for its link with the small british company 
 but tvs stunned industry analysts last month by disclosing that it expected mtm to post an operating loss for this year 
 in that announcement tvs also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new u.s. sales manager 
 mr. gatward has spent a lot of time since late september at mtm 's headquarters he eliminated three departments and fired six executives according to the tvs spokesman 
 further staff cuts are likely the spokesman indicated 
 obviously we are looking at making economies across the board 
 tvs blames difficulties in peddling reruns of mtm shows to u.s. broadcasters for the problems at mtm

 two rival bidders for connaught <unk> extended their offers to acquire the toronto-based vaccine manufacturer friday

 a c$ <unk> bid by ciba-geigy ltd. a pharmaceutical company based in <unk> switzerland and <unk> chiron corp. a <unk> concern was extended to nov. N 
 it had been due to expire friday evening 
 merieux previously said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover 
 merieux a vaccine and <unk> firm based in <unk> france is controlled N N by state-owned <unk> <unk> s.a 
 the canadian government previously said merieux 's bid did n't offer enough net benefit to canada to be approved and gave merieux an until <unk> to submit additional information 
 merieux officials said last week that they are highly confident the offer will be approved once it <unk> details of its proposed investments to federal regulators 
 both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of connaught 's shares outstanding 
 <unk> merieux which already holds a N N stake in connaught said that at the close of business thursday N shares of connaught and c$ N million face amount of debentures convertible into N common shares had been tendered to its offer 
 at the close of business thursday ciba-geigy and chiron said N common shares had been tendered to their offer 
 at last report connaught had N million shares outstanding 
 separately the ontario supreme court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the university of toronto against connaught in connection with the merieux bid 
 in a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and connaught the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a c N million research accord it is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits of the case at this time 
 lawyers for the two sides were n't immediately available for comment 
 the university had sought an injunction blocking connaught 's board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by merieux

 after days of intense but <unk> negotiations a federal judge last week threatened to convert william herbert hunt 's chapter N personal bankruptcy case into a chapter N liquidation 
 judge harold c. abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a <unk> between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into <unk> 
 if the case is converted to chapter N what remains of the oil <unk> 's <unk> estate now believed to have a value of less than $ N million would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the internal revenue service whose claim for $ N million in back taxes has priority in the case 
 hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing according to attorneys involved 
 while admitting such a move would be devastating to most creditors judge abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on mr. hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact that following voting by creditors none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form 
 it would be a shame to have a chapter N after all the progress in this case said judge abramson 
 under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code a company continues to operate under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts 
 under chapter N the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors 
 despite his reluctance to take the latter step the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between manufacturers hanover trust co. and minpeco s.a. a minerals concern owned by the <unk> <unk> 
 the manufacturers hanover corp. unit which is seeking repayment of a $ N million loan has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of minpeco which won a $ N million judgment against mr. hunt his brother nelson <unk> hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in 
 while claiming that penalties legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $ N million minpeco has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $ N million 
 but even that is disputed by manufacturers hanover which in alliance with the irs contends that minpeco has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the <unk> case 
 under <unk> from judge abramson a minpeco executive flew in from peru last week to talk directly with executives from manufacturers hanover on a settlement 
 despite long private sessions in both new york and dallas the two sides ended the week N miles and many dollars apart according to attorney <unk> ray who represents manufacturers hanover 
 meanwhile inside the courtroom the judge said he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $ N every time they referred to each other with terms such as <unk> or <unk> 
 all three major creditors the irs minpeco and manufacturers hanover voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by mr. hunt 
 a reorganization plan proposed jointly by the irs and manufacturers hanover was stalled by a negative vote from minpeco 
 the mineral concern 's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the irs and manufacturers hanover 
 neither plan is dead however and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the <unk> hanover dispute 
 meanwhile settlement negotiations continue between mr. hunt and the irs which has already reached a tentative agreement with nelson <unk> hunt 
 the two sides have been far apart on how much herbert hunt will continue to owe the government after his assets are sold

 when the economy <unk> in the mid-1970s akzo <unk> fell out of bed 
 <unk> overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business which accounted for half of the dutch chemical company 's sales led to huge losses and left akzo 's survival in doubt 
 it was n't until the early 1980s that akzo <unk> itself back to health 
 now as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms akzo says it is in far better shape to cope 
 investment analysts generally agree 
 aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants akzo has spent N billion guilders $ N billion on acquisitions since N to give it better balance 
 during the same period the company has sold about N billion guilders of assets 
 the fibers business whose products go into <unk> carpeting and <unk> industrial uses now accounts for only N N of akzo 's sales 
 we have definitely become less cyclical <unk> bergsma executive vice <unk> said in an interview 
 still akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription drugs 
 mr. bergsma said prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies remain too high making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area 
 but he said akzo is considering alliances with american drug companies although he would n't elaborate 
 an indication of akzo 's success in <unk> itself will come thursday when it reports third-quarter results 
 analysts expect the company to show profit of about N million guilders up N N from N million guilders a year earlier 
 a bigger test will come next year if as many analysts expect bulk chemical prices slump in europe 
 maybe akzo can surprise the investment world a bit said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> bank <unk> 
 he figures akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year 
 the bank projects akzo will show per-share earnings of N guilders in N up from an estimated N guilders for this year and the N guilders reported for N 
 at james capel & co. in london analyst <unk> <unk> notes that akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products 
 for example akzo has only minor petrochemical operations is small in plastics and does n't make <unk> 
 thus while akzo <unk> less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics it has less to fear from the current slump 
 the company is exposed to bulk chemicals however 
 although <unk> prices have begun falling in the u.s. they are generally stable in europe mr. bergsma said 
 a decline may come in the first half of N he said but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn 
 to reduce the danger of such pricing cycles akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals 
 akzo 's biggest move in this area was the N acquisition of <unk> chemical co. 's specialty chemical business for $ N million 
 in a less glamorous field akzo is the world 's biggest producer of industrial salt used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as <unk> ice 
 akzo also makes products derived from salt such as <unk> and <unk> soda 
 in the fibers division profit remains weak largely because of persistent overcapacity 
 but akzo is still <unk> down it recently announced plans to eliminate about N <unk> jobs in the netherlands and west germany 
 although the <unk> and <unk> markets remain mostly bleak akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses such carbon fibers and <unk> extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as <unk> <unk> 
 akzo 's <unk> <unk> fiber is a distant second to du pont co. 's <unk> which dominates the market 
 mr. bergsma said world-wide industry sales of <unk> fibers are expected to total about $ N million this year 
 sales growth of N N a year seems possible he said and akzo expects its <unk> business to become profitable in N 
 akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in <unk> auto <unk> and industrial coatings 
 in august for example it completed the $ N million acquisition of reliance universal inc. a u.s. maker of industrial coatings for wood metals and plastics from tyler corp 
 mr. bergsma said akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it <unk> cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale 
 for akzo 's drug business where profits have shown <unk> change for the past five years mr. bergsma predicted moderate profit growth 
 akzo is the leading seller of <unk> pills in europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the u.s. and japan 
 mr. bergsma said akzo hopes to have approval to sell its <unk> pill in the u.s. in N 
 akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests generic drugs and <unk> products 
 <unk> products are showing especially strong growth mr. bergsma said 
 among the leading products is a <unk> shot for horses 
 we 're sorry to see nigel lawson 's departure from the british government 
 he is a politician with the <unk> of true conviction as in <unk> <unk> exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to N N 
 but in the end his resignation as chancellor of the exchequer may be a good thing especially if it works as he no doubt intends by forcing prime minister thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to <unk> the genuine intellectual issues involved 
 the early <unk> we admit <unk> suggest so <unk> an outcome 
 the fleet street reaction was captured in the guardian headline departure reveals thatcher poison 
 british politicians divide into two groups of <unk> those with their <unk> cut and those <unk> the sky is falling 
 so far as we can see only two persons are <unk> with a dignity recognizing the <unk> of the issues mr. lawson and sir alan walters the <unk> of the chancellor 's difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to mrs. thatcher 
 the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates conservative free-market economists divide into at least three <unk> camps 
 there are the strict <unk> who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates 
 there are the <unk> <unk> who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates 
 and there are the <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> to balance trade flows 
 this is a problem not only for prime minister thatcher but for president bush as shown in the ongoing <unk> over the dollar between the federal reserve and the mulford treasury 
 in the british case mr. lawson is the <unk> thing in london to a <unk> <unk> 
 he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially <unk> fresh growth in britain but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the european monetary system 
 while no doubt agreeing with mr. lawson on everything else sir alan is a <unk> <unk> inclined to defend floating rates to the death 
 to make matters even more confusing the earlier u.s. experience made clear that mr. lawson 's tax cuts would have <unk> effects on britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling 
 they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows 
 by accounting <unk> this had to produce a sudden trade deficit 
 as in the u.s. it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates <unk> 
 at this point the options were crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as sir alan surely advised and forget the soaring pound 
 to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy britain has repeatedly proved <unk> 
 or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate as the chancellor argued and ensure the <unk> of this policy by joining the ems 
 faced with a similar situation paul <unk> let the dollar soar though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly <unk> issued <unk> warnings of inflation 
 but this <unk> the u.s. manufacturing sector laying the seeds of <unk> 
 mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark 
 he <unk> inflation along with rapid growth no doubt <unk> sir alan 's predictions in the prime minister 's mind 
 but more recently the pound has been falling with high inflation which has also seemed almost <unk> to the high interest rates mr. lawson deployed to stop it 
 so the british experience presents a genuine <unk> that reaches far beyond the <unk> of <unk> 
 we had been soliciting opinions on it long before mr. lawson 's resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy john major 
 to begin with we should note that in contrast to the u.s. deficit britain has been running <unk> budget surpluses 
 in pursuit of this mystery <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> need not apply 
 we should also add mr. lawson 's own explanation as we understand it 
 unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a <unk> reduction in real wages 
 the wage <unk> which <unk> studies confirm is particularly high in britain gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation 
 inflation is easier to spark and harder to control 
 we should also concede that in the british experience the <unk> cause <unk> some of the credibility it lost in the u.s. experience 
 nearby paul craig roberts a distinguished <unk> with <unk> <unk> argues the case for sir alan 
 perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event mr. lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one 
 we recall that mr. roberts not only <unk> the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to <unk> sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. <unk> was too tight when he let the dollar rise 
 somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by <unk> but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity 
 the <unk> tend to think mr. lawson ran onto technical <unk> 
 in <unk> rates the choice of initial <unk> is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong <unk> rate 
 for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency 
 we <unk> with mrs. thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one <unk> by the domestic political <unk> of west germany 
 perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another <unk> <unk> <unk> economy 
 alan reynolds of <unk> adds his <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> is the budget surplus 
 those who can shake <unk> ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of <unk> for cash is equivalent to an <unk> <unk> operation indeed it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply 
 mr. reynolds also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession 
 we would add that in political terms mrs. thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the chancellor and her adviser 
 in the end neither policy was followed and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery 
 in particular <unk> a currency is anything but <unk> it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility 
 all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy 
 better to have a true <unk> policy just for the experience 
 so mr. lawson had to resign 
 in the end his move was sparked by remarks in <unk> from sir alan 's <unk> in the american economist a <unk> academic journal 
 but it was the underlying situation that became <unk> 
 what mr. major and mrs. thatcher will do now remains to be seen 
 they <unk> <unk> inflation and a sagging economy that is to say <unk> 
 this can not be solved by <unk> a further downturn reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation 
 our advice is this immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through <unk> tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that <unk> both supply and demand for money which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do 
 this was the version of <unk> economics that in the late 1970s and early '80s worked in america and world-wide to solve a far more serious <unk> than <unk> britain today 
 ogilvy & mather whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by wpp group earlier this year will see its profit margins bounce back to the N N range in N said graham phillips the agency 's new <unk> 
 the ad agency 's pretax profit margins were slightly under N N at the time of the takeover according to analysts london-based wpp 's goal is to increase margins to N N 
 mr. phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency 
 <unk> the <unk> ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed kenneth roman who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at american express an ogilvy client 
 surrounded by <unk> of paper two computers and photos of himself <unk> and flying mr. phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency 
 first and <unk> mr. phillips said he hopes to improve client service 
 ogilvy under the <unk> mr. roman gained a reputation as occasionally being <unk> in its treatment of clients of <unk> what strategy a client should indeed must follow 
 and some of its top <unk> executives including mr. phillips were <unk> to the point they were <unk> with administrative duties with little time to see clients 
 but mr. phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by <unk> much of his administrative work to a deputy 
 he also plans to get to know clients that mr. roman was closer to such as <unk> brothers american express and seagram 
 the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins 
 clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business not once a month but two or three times a week he said 
 mr. phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the wpp takeover 
 the reorganization is supposed to make <unk> shopping buying advertising public relations and design all in one place or ogilvy <unk> in <unk> a reality 
 under the reorganization ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director to work as the client 's single contact for all those services 
 there is little or no integration of our work quality is <unk> there is no single focus mr. phillips complained to staffers in march when the reorganization was announced 
 now mr. phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients including american express american telephone & telegraph and ryder by year 's end 
 industry executives and analysts are divided on whether mr. phillips is up to the task 
 he is n't as well-known to clients as is mr. roman 
 under his watch office <unk> was often rampant in the agency 's new york operation and the office there has had a dismal <unk> record for more than a year 
 and while last week the agency hired a top <unk> executive bill hamilton to try to bolster its work graham has to get the revenue of that new york office moving says james <unk> an analyst with county natwest securities 
 the one thing mr. phillips clearly does have going for him is <unk> although it is n't certain if that will be enough 
 as mr. <unk> says the last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top and graham is obviously a long-term member of the ogilvy mafia as we call it 
 mr. phillips and mr. roman are indeed quite similar in substance if not in style 
 while mr. roman is a <unk> <unk> mr. phillips would rather delegate leaving him time for his interests outside the office 
 mr. roman by contrast seems rarely to cut loose at all although he did appear at ogilvy 's halloween party friday <unk> out in duck feet and a duck hat <unk> as a <unk> duck 
 mr. phillips said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to <unk> <unk> new new york headquarters 
 the move <unk> at about $ N million actually came in at about $ N million he said 
 but margins will be helped too by some other <unk> steps 
 ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff closed the executive <unk> room and after the takeover let go half a dozen financial executives 
 wpp which assumes financial control of its businesses in a <unk> way instituted a new financial system and plans to <unk> some floors in ogilvy 's new headquarters building to outsiders 
 the fact that the agency will now be part of a u.k. company under british accounting rules will also make the profit picture look better 
 <unk> 's klein steps down 
 arthur klein president of young & rubicam 's new york office stepped down temporarily in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in new haven conn. that he the agency and another top executive <unk> <unk> tourist officials to win its account in N 
 in an internal memo alex <unk> the agency 's chairman said mr. klein decided to remove himself to minimize negative reaction from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense 
 the fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could <unk> have an adverse impact on <unk> mr. <unk> wrote 
 he said mr. klein will return to his post at the end of the trial at which he will be <unk> 
 mr. klein will work with mr. <unk> on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending 
 peter <unk> president of <unk> 's ad operations will assume mr. klein 's day-to-day role 
 wells rich 's new partner 
 wells rich greene named <unk> heller as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group which <unk> on fashion and <unk> <unk> advertising 
 ms. heller N had headed up boston agency <unk> a unit of wcrs 
 the agency with about $ N million in billings will be <unk> with some of its staffers absorbed by wcrs 's della femina mcnamee unit in boston ms. heller said 
 she said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients including reebok and apple 
 at wells rich ms. heller will concentrate on accounts that include philip morris 's benson & hedges cigarette brand which relies on print ads ms. heller 's specialty 
 as previously reported the account is troubled with philip morris asking backer spielvogel bates ogilvy & mather and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work 
 wells rich declined to comment on the status of the account as did the other agencies

 r.h. macy & co. the closely held department store chain said in a financial filing friday that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended july N were up N N to $ N billion against $ N billion a year earlier 
 comparable store sales for the quarter were up N N 
 the net loss for the quarter was $ N million against a year-earlier loss of $ N million 
 the loss in the fourth quarter of N reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for federated department stores inc. as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations 
 for the year sales were up N N to $ N billion compared with $ N billion in fiscal N 
 sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of i. <unk> bullock 's and <unk> <unk> 
 macy acquired those three businesses in may N 
 on a comparable store basis including the new acquisitions for both years sales for fiscal N were up N N 
 macy reported a net loss for fiscal N of $ N million compared with a net loss of $ N million for fiscal N 
 the company 's earnings before interest taxes and depreciation which bondholders use a measurement of the chain 's ability to pay its existing debt increased N N in fiscal N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the $ N million figures includes the new acquisitions 
 excluding those businesses earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for N would have been $ N million 
 as of feb. N N the <unk> <unk> stores will operate as i. <unk> stores 
 altogether macy and its subsidiaries own or lease N department stores and N specialty stores nationwide 
 although management led a leveraged buy-out of r.h. macy in july N the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt 
 the company estimates its total debt at about $ N billion 
 this includes $ N billion of long-term debt $ N million in short-term debt and $ N million of the current portion of long-term debt 
 in a letter to investors chairman edward s. finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors 
 while our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want 
 mr. finkelstein is apparently referring to b. altman and <unk> teller two new york retailers that have recently filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled campeau corp 
 those chains include bloomingdale 's which campeau recently said it will sell 
 other retail properties for sale include saks fifth avenue and marshall field retailers now owned by b.a.t plc the british tobacco conglomerate 
 in his letter mr. finkelstein also referred to the recent san francisco earthquake 
 mr. finkelstein flew to san francisco the day after the earthquake and found that N to N of his company 's stores had sustained some damage including the <unk> of most windows at the i. <unk> store on union square 
 the volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive but looking at the whole fiscal year we do n't see the effect as material wrote mr. finkelstein 
 rjr nabisco inc. said it agreed to sell its baby ruth <unk> and <unk> candy businesses to nestle s.a. 's nestle foods unit for $ N million 
 the sale at a higher price than some analysts had expected helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts nestle 's N N share of the u.s. candy market to about N N 
 the candy businesses had sales of about $ N million last year which was roughly N N of total revenue for rjr 's <unk> <unk> unit according to a memorandum distributed by rjr 's owner kohlberg kravis roberts & co. to bankers last december 
 the nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in franklin park ill. which employs about N workers 
 the sale which had been expected is part of kkr 's program to pay down $ N billion of a $ N billion bridge loan by february 
 roughly $ N billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales and rjr expects to use another $ N billion from the pending two-part sale of most of its del monte unit 
 that sale however could still fall through if financing problems develop 
 thus it remains crucial for rjr to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands 
 louis <unk> jr. chairman and chief executive officer of new york-based rjr called the sale a significant step in the company 's divestiture program as well as a a strategic divestiture 
 since kkr bought rjr in february for $ N billion of debt it has agreed to sell nearly $ N billion of rjr assets 
 rjr 's executives have said they will <unk> with certain brands in particular that are n't leaders in their markets 
 rjr nabisco and <unk> <unk> will concentrate more on our own core businesses mr. <unk> said friday 
 baby ruth and <unk> are both among the <unk> N <unk> bars in the u.s. but rjr 's overall share of the roughly $ N billion market is less than N N 
 nestle 's share of N N before friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders <unk> foods corp. and <unk> inc. which have about N N and N N of the market respectively 
 this means nestle is now in the <unk> business in a big way said <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> <unk> <unk> magazine 
 for them it makes all kinds of sense 
 they 've been given a mandate from switzerland to expand their u.s. <unk> operations 
 nestle s.a. is based in <unk> switzerland 
 the new candy bars make an important contribution to our nestle foods commitment to this very important strategic unit said c. alan macdonald president of nestle foods in purchase n.y 
 aetna life & casualty co. 's third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or $ N a share reflecting the damages from hurricane hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions 
 catastrophe losses reduced aetna 's net income by $ N million including $ N million from hugo 
 last year catastrophe losses totaled $ N million when net was $ N million or $ N a share 
 the year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change 
 the insurer has started processing claims from the northern california earthquake nearly two weeks ago 
 but because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading friday aetna closed at $ N down N cents 
 in the latest quarter aetna had a $ N million loss on its <unk> line compared with earnings of $ N million last year 
 profit for its commercial insurance division fell N N to $ N million reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for nearly three years 
 however aetna 's employee benefits division which includes its group health insurance operations posted a N N profit gain to $ N million 
 third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ N million which included $ N million from the sale of federated investors in august and a $ N million tax credit 
 in the nine months net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share last year 
 out of the <unk> of <unk> are coming words of <unk> 
 here at a <unk> stadium near the black township of <unk> yesterday were eight leaders of the african national congress seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government 
 here were more than N anc supporters gathering for the first anc rally inside south africa since the black liberation movement was banned in N 
 here was the state security <unk> poised to <unk> on any words or acts of <unk> let alone revolution 
 but the words that <unk> over the <unk> <unk> messages of peace unity negotiation and discipline 
 we stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow said walter sisulu the anc 's former secretary general who along with five of his colleagues served N years in prison before being released two weeks ago 
 some members of the huge crowd shouted <unk> peace <unk> 
 these are <unk> times in south african politics 
 the government and the anc the <unk> of enemies are engaged in an elaborate <unk> dance designed to <unk> each other to the negotiating table 
 pretoria releases the anc leaders most of whom were serving life sentences and allows them to speak freely hoping that the anc will abandon its use of violence 
 the anc leaders speak in <unk> of <unk> <unk> discipline hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps such as <unk> nelson <unk> the most prominent anc figure and <unk> the organization 
 the government of president <unk> de <unk> is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions 
 meanwhile the many organizations inside the country that back the anc are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and <unk> their supporters even though the state of emergency which has severely curtailed black opposition remains in force 
 the result is that the <unk> and <unk> are happening 
 six months ago government approval for an anc rally was <unk> 
 equally <unk> is that the anc given the chance to hold a rally would extend a hand <unk> <unk> to the government 
 in a message read out at the rally <unk> anc president oliver <unk> who ca n't legally be quoted in south africa said the country was at a <unk> and that mr. de <unk> may yet earn a place among the <unk> of our country if he chooses a path of genuine political settlement 
 still this does n't mean that either the government or the anc is changing <unk> or that either has moved significantly closer to the other 
 the government may ease repression in some areas but it still keeps a tight grip in others 
 for instance it releases mr. sisulu without conditions yet his son <unk> a newspaper editor is restricted to his home much of the day and is n't allowed to work as a journalist 
 the anc <unk> to keep up pressure on the government 
 <unk> yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue <unk> emergency restrictions and racial <unk> known as apartheid 
 we can not wait on the government to make changes at its own pace mr. sisulu said 
 because the anc remains banned both the government which approved the rally and the <unk> who <unk> it denied it was an anc rally 
 they both called it a welcome home gathering 
 nevertheless an anc rally by any other name is still an anc rally 
 the recently released leaders sat high <unk> a <unk> in one section of the stadium stands 
 behind them was a huge anc flag and an even bigger sign that said anc lives anc leads 
 next to them was the red flag of the outlawed south african communist party which has long been an anc ally 
 in the stands people <unk> anc flags wore anc <unk> sang anc <unk> and <unk> anc <unk> 
 today said mr. sisulu the anc has captured the center stage of political life in south africa 
 as a police helicopter <unk> overhead mr. sisulu repeated the anc 's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations release all political <unk> <unk> lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations remove all troops from the black <unk> end the state of emergency and cease all political trials and political executions 
 if these conditions are met he said the anc would be prepared to discuss <unk> its guerrilla activities 
 there can be no question of us <unk> abandoning the armed struggle he said 
 to date we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations 
 all their <unk> are vague 
 <unk> a phrase from mr. de <unk> mr. sisulu said let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new south africa 
 when westinghouse electric corp. <unk> its massive steam <unk> plant in <unk> pa. three years ago it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its <unk> power generation business 
 but now westinghouse is enjoying a <unk> in demand for both steam and combustion <unk> and may even join the growing <unk> of independent electric producers 
 and with its new venture with japan 's mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. announced last week it is poised to <unk> growing markets overseas 
 for the first time since the mid-1970s westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants 
 most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities and westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years 
 analysts agree predicting that the revived market could significantly boost westinghouse 's bottom line in coming years 
 westinghouse 's earnings could be <unk> enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner says russell l. <unk> of salomon brothers inc 
 the company expects a need for N <unk> of new generation in the u.s. over the next decade 
 already this year it has received orders for four <unk> advanced combustion <unk> from florida power & light co. and for two <unk> plants from <unk> energy corp. among others 
 westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing 
 in the past the company usually took <unk> equity positions in power plants it supplied as a <unk> to close deals 
 but last june 's <unk> that westinghouse would put up all of the $ N million to build a new <unk> plant could herald a new age 
 westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the southern california edison co. and backup power and steam to the u.s. <unk> & chemical co 
 we have n't decided on a strategy yet but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier says <unk> stern executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group 
 at the same time westinghouse hopes its venture with mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition particularly in the u.s. from such european competitors as asea brown boveri ag siemens ag and british general electric co 
 under the agreement westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion <unk> from its japanese partner and package and sell them with its own <unk> and other equipment 
 westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with <unk> giving it an edge in developing asian markets 
 in addition the two companies will develop new steam <unk> technology such as the plants ordered by florida power and even <unk> each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations 
 even though we 'll still compete against mitsubishi we can also work jointly on some projects and we 'll gain a lot of <unk> flexibility mr. stern contends 
 the <unk> venture was designed as a <unk> transaction <unk> any possible antitrust concerns 
 westinghouse carefully <unk> the agreement because the justice department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam <unk> joint venture with asea brown boveri 
 it is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which unlike utilities are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants 
 westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for <unk> to come from independent producers for at least the next six years 
 despite <unk> of the company 's <unk> and east pittsburgh plants the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in north carolina 
 still westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could <unk> if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity 
 even if that scenario occurs westinghouse figures it is prepared 
 the company already is <unk> up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade 
 john c. marous chairman and chief executive officer says he expects a commercial order by N for the company 's <unk> nuclear power plant which is under development 
 once we see an order we expect it 'll be on line by N 
 among the things i learned covering the world series these past few weeks is that the richter scale which measures earthquakes is n't like the one in your <unk> 
 a quake that measures two on the richter is n't twice as severe as a one it 's N times worse 
 a three is N times N again and so on 
 that put the seven of oct. N in perspective for me 
 think i 'll buy one of those i survived <unk> after all 
 by <unk> standards the show that the oakland athletics put on friday and saturday nights in putting a <unk> swift end to the game 's longest short series rated somewhere between a N and an N 
 the boys with the white <unk> on their <unk> might not have made the earth move much but they certainly did some impressive things with <unk> 
 the pale <unk> propelled six of <unk> out of the unfriendly <unk> of candlestick park during the two games en route to N and N wins over the san francisco giants 
 combined with their two <unk> victories way back on oct. N and N the scores were N and N remember that gave them a sweep of the <unk> series 
 the joke here is that the giants lost by de fault 
 that 's <unk> correct but a <unk> unfair otherwise 
 they showed up but did n't or could n't challenge 
 they led for <unk> an inning in the four games and managed to stir their fans only once 
 that came in the seventh inning of game four when <unk> N they scored four times and brought their big heat will clark and kevin mitchell to the plate with one out and a <unk> on 
 but clark <unk> out to short right field and mitchell 's drive to left was caught on the warning track by <unk> henderson as N sets of <unk> <unk> as one 
 i went out to <unk> burns the a 's <unk> and told him that we were n't <unk> <unk> let this guy beat us said oakland <unk> terry <unk> of the decisive confrontation with mitchell the national league 's <unk> <unk> king 
 i told him to make mitchell reach for everything and that 's what we did 
 the ball he hit was n't a strike 
 if it had been he <unk> hit it out 
 but if the a 's had n't won in four they would have prevailed in five or six or seven 
 the best team won this series which is more unusual than it may sound 
 baseball ai n't football where the good teams beat up on the bad ones 
 the best baseball teams win six of N games and the worst win four of N 
 without becoming overly contentious allow me to suggest that several recent <unk> of the world according to us as in u.s. might not have ranked no. N in many polls 
 that list includes last season 's <unk> the los angeles <unk> who rode a <unk> home run by kirk <unk> and two <unk> pitching performances by <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> over a <unk> bothered oakland crew 
 these a 's however got few grades as low as b on their N report card 
 they led the major <unk> in regular-season wins with N and <unk> the toronto blue <unk> four games to one for the american league <unk> before <unk> their <unk> rivals 
 the <unk> testimony to their domination of the <unk> <unk> came from giants ' manager roger craig after his team had fallen in game three to a <unk> <unk> that tied a <unk> series record 
 asked what he would do differently on the <unk> craig allowed that he might play his <unk> deeper maybe on the other side of the <unk> 
 the a 's offensive showing in the series got an a as in <unk> 
 their N total bases broke a record for a four-game set and their nine home runs tied one 
 eight oakland players hit <unk> with <unk> dave henderson getting two both on friday 
 <unk> henderson the <unk> <unk> man had nine hits and set or tied four-game series marks for <unk> N and stolen bases N 
 the sole a not to homer was cleanup <unk> mark <unk> their regular-season leader with N and he contributed five hits plus a <unk> <unk> play on a ground ball in game three that stopped a giant rally while the issue still was in doubt 
 think i 'll <unk> my image get this changed to a <unk> <unk> the big first <unk> saturday night <unk> the gold bat he wears on a neck chain 
 even with that power show though the oakland series ' star certified by the most valuable player award was a <unk> dave stewart 
 he shut out the giants on five hits in game one and allowed three runs on five hits in seven <unk> friday after the <unk> break caused by the earthquake 
 stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds 
 one was that despite his N regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the land beyond the late news he has been <unk> by his <unk> <unk> and missed out on prizes that might have been his due 
 the other is that he 's an oakland native and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to <unk> areas last week 
 afterward as the a 's <unk> their victory with beer they <unk> with traditional champagne <unk> in <unk> to the quake victims stewart said he thought his <unk> ring would <unk> his individual <unk> 
 give me four or five more series with these guys and i do n't care if i ever win a <unk> young he said in reference to baseball 's <unk> award 
 indeed the possibility of an a 's ring cycle <unk> a <unk> was a major topic of <unk> discussion saturday so much so that <unk> <unk> the team 's general manager felt obliged to <unk> it 
 people change teams change he cautioned 
 it 's easier to get worse than better in this game 
 he might have added an interesting historical fact the last series sweep by the cincinnati <unk> came in N which also was the first year of baseball player free agency 
 it was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous big market teams to <unk> the best talent but quite the opposite has occurred twelve different clubs have won titles in the N seasons since its advent 
 the number includes such <unk> <unk> as well oakland 
 the rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can is clear your company will benefit in terms of market share customer satisfaction and profitability 
 in fact managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive <unk> than ever before 
 however for many managing speed does not come naturally 
 most of us grew up <unk> in the <unk> <unk> makes waste and do n't cut corners ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed says dean <unk> vice president for product integrity at grumman corp 
 but in the real world you learn that speed and quality are not a <unk> 
 speed is a component of quality one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers 
 companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations 
 managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed and shift some responsibility for analyzing improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees 
 one team at the federal express ground operations station in <unk> mass. focused on a particularly <unk> operation the morning package sort 
 every morning <unk> trucks arrive at the <unk> ground station from boston 's <unk> airport carrying the day 's package load 
 in peak periods that load may include N pieces 
 the packages must be <unk> quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery so <unk> can be on the road by N 
 no customer is present at the morning package sort but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction 
 we 're committed to deliver the customer 's package by a stated time usually N notes glenn <unk> a federal express <unk> who led the <unk> team 
 the sooner our vans hit the road each morning the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation 
 following a <unk> formula used by teams throughout federal express members of the <unk> team monitored their morning routine carefully noting where and when the work group 's resources were used effectively and where they were idle waiting for others <unk> in the process to send packages their way 
 we suspected there was <unk> built into our process 
 but we did n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering mr. <unk> says 
 we used the data to <unk> our <unk> system and put our resources where they could do the most good 
 the team even created a points system to identify those <unk> and <unk> that were doing the most to reduce <unk> cycle time 
 winners of the friendly competition earn a <unk> dinner out with their spouses 
 monitoring shows that the <unk> team 's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort reports james <unk> chief operating officer at federal express 
 the vans leave at least N minutes earlier on average than they used to 
 and service levels have increased to the point where they 're consistently above N N 
 a <unk> team at union carbide 's <unk> n.y. facility which produces <unk> plants followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time 
 the team included <unk> from the shop floor as well as engineering scheduling and purchasing personnel reports alan <unk> director of quality 
 first they produced a <unk> detailing the process by which an <unk> plant actually gets built 
 then they identified <unk> in the process 
 the <unk> team determined that <unk> for <unk> were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical <unk> and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line 
 the team then proposed modifications in their work process to management 
 the <unk> manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways mr. <unk> concludes 
 first we have better quality assurance than ever because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work 
 second we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product 
 at grumman 's aircraft systems division a <unk> team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract 
 the team was composed of representatives from engineering manufacturing corporate estimating flight test material quality control and other departments 
 we needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal says carl <unk> <unk> manager for grumman 's <unk> combat aircraft program 
 but instead of gathering their input <unk> we formed the team which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved 
 armed with this shared understanding and <unk> background information each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal <unk> data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule 
 we cleared up questions and <unk> very quickly because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team mr. <unk> explains 
 the team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals 
 the team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate 
 the result was a more <unk> complete and competitive proposal mr. <unk> concludes 
 the successes achieved at federal express union carbide and grumman suggest that managing speed may be an <unk> source of competitive advantage 
 managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction 
 they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time 
 and they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work 
 mr. <unk> is president of <unk> a consulting firm in burlington mass 
 home taping of <unk> music cuts into record industry revenues but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more 
 that 's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the office of technology assessment at the request of the house and senate judiciary committees 
 the report is to be released today 
 the report says the availability of such advanced <unk> recording equipment as <unk> recorders does n't seem to increase the quantity of home copying 
 that finding the report says <unk> doubt on the record industry 's <unk> that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of <unk> material by home <unk> 
 the longstanding position of the recording industry association of america a trade group based in washington d.c. is that record companies performers <unk> and music publishers need to be <unk> by <unk> fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping 
 i think it is a <unk> in the <unk> in any royalty tax proposal says gary shapiro vice president for government and legal affairs of the electronic industries association in washington 
 what the report shows is everything we 've been saying for the past eight or nine years that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry 
 the people who tape the most buy the most 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> for <unk> says her organization has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment 
 a recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape or <unk> recorder sold in the u.s. have a <unk> device that restricts its ability to make second copies from <unk> tape copies of digital compact disks 
 but the disappointing sales of <unk> machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal <unk> that went into the agreement 
 under current copyright laws it is considered fair use to <unk> <unk> material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's family or friends while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited 
 a survey contained in the <unk> report copyright and home copying technology challenges the law found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a right a right moreover that was exercised by N N of americans over the age of N in the past year 
 the study says that the <unk> legal status of home copying makes it appropriate to examine the effects on consumers as well as on industry 
 reports by the office of technology assessment do n't <unk> any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that congress may pursue 
 the study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de <unk> changes to copyright law through technology and says that finding an appropriate balance of <unk> and benefits is a political decision not a technical one 
 switzerland 's most famous raider says he is n't one 
 werner k. rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly 
 and in little more than a decade of being friendly and at the same time <unk> the <unk> swiss business community with some <unk> <unk> and dealing the <unk> mr. rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire 
 he achieved this in part with an <unk> talent for getting his foot <unk> in the door of established european companies 
 his latest coup september 's <unk> of the five billion <unk> $ N billion merger between <unk> s.a. the world 's second-largest temporary employment agency and <unk> international s.a. a <unk> <unk> company 
 shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late november 
 but approval is almost certain since mr. rey and a friendly <unk> management are in control 
 after the transaction mr. rey estimates the value of his N N stake in the new company to be held by his omni holding ag will be about N billion swiss francs 
 this will be his return on an original investment of between N million swiss francs and N million swiss francs 
 mr. rey bought a controlling stake in <unk> for N million swiss francs in N building up the <unk> engineering company with european and u.s. acquisitions 
 i like to succeed says mr. rey during a recent morning of working at home which he also likes 
 home is an estate with green <unk> opening onto lake geneva and a <unk> house whose rooms <unk> the water and offer a view of the french <unk> 
 in the corner of his reception room is a delicate <unk> desk <unk> high with <unk> 
 there is a small <unk> on the wall 
 <unk> magazine <unk> lists mr. rey as having a fortune of about N billion swiss francs 
 writes <unk> no one in switzerland ever came so far so fast 
 he was simply the first in this country to realize that <unk> were just lying around waiting to be picked up 
 in short rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets 
 however the swiss financial press in general as well as many analysts have had a hard time making up their minds about mr. rey and his <unk> ways 
 for switzerland 's most prestigious newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. rey seems <unk> to remain the former bally raider an image that has proved hard to overcome 
 in N as an <unk> in the eyes of switzerland 's establishment mr. rey laid the foundations of his <unk> <unk> with an <unk> <unk> on bally the country 's traditional <unk> 
 sitting <unk> a banker at a <unk> in london where he was working as a financial consultant he learned that a large <unk> of bally 's shares was up for sale 
 looking into bally he could hardly believe what he saw a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major european cities and a market capitalization of N million swiss francs it had N employees 
 investing four million swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million swiss francs from his parents and his wife mr. rey acquired N N of bally 's shares 
 but such tactics were <unk> to switzerland in N and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain 
 eventually mr. rey was forced to sell his bally shares to the weapons maker <unk> holding ag as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys ' network 
 mr. rey made N million swiss francs on the sale 
 bally was not an unfriendly takeover he insists 
 buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible mr. rey contends 
 i bought from willing shareholders 
 nevertheless mr. rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome 
 and he has worked to shed his raider image 
 in N his career as an <unk> began with the acquisition of the swiss metals works <unk> based in <unk> 
 with the <unk> metals business undermined in switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs this looked like a <unk> undertaking 
 but mr. rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country 's major producers the increased efficiency has <unk> up the industry 
 three years later machinery producer <unk> de <unk> <unk> de <unk> s.a. was to become part of the rey empire 
 once again the company 's future looked less than <unk> 
 but after restructuring under new management the profits began rolling in 
 a major boost to mr. rey 's respectability among the swiss came in N when he sold N N of his <unk> bank to the conservative swiss <unk> banks 
 they renamed it swiss <unk> and are using it to expand abroad 
 in N mr. rey <unk> leading publishing houses to take over switzerland 's jean <unk> ag a major producer of magazines and newspapers 
 and with the recent acquisition of N N of <unk> machinery manufacturer <unk> <unk> ag mr. rey has enjoyed the status of white knight 
 <unk> preferred him to financier <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the company 's stock had led to a bitter battle 
 meanwhile as such strategic investments have mounted the <unk> arm of mr. rey 's omni holding has been <unk> buying and selling dozens of companies often after a financial or corporate restructuring 
 today this branch of mr. rey 's empire runs under the name <unk> offering services and handles mergers and acquisitions placement of securities and real estate 
 in its portfolio are such diverse companies as united <unk> air europe <unk> inc. a u.s. company that makes supermarket <unk> machines <unk> industries a u.s. manufacturer of securities systems <unk> systems inc. a u.s. regional telephone company and major real-estate projects in the u.s. and europe 
 for financial analysts reading omni 's accounts is a tough challenge 
 companies move in and out says <unk> <unk> of <unk> swiss investment 
 financial analysts note that mr. rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests 
 in august omni unexpectedly bought <unk> 's N N stake in <unk> ag of west germany a <unk> company 
 the internal transaction within the rey empire <unk> <unk> 's small shareholders but analysts say it makes sense for <unk> to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help 
 mr. rey says the move is yet another example of his <unk> 
 he explains that companies with real estate give security 
 the real estate can be used he points out as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development 
 he says he wants to influence but not manage companies 
 i do n't want to be like financier alan bond and the other <unk> 
 i do n't want companies to be built around me as a person 
 i want them to stand alone

 in the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year boeing co. said it will create a defense and space group to consolidate several divisions 
 meanwhile boeing officials and representatives of the machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the <unk> strike that has shut the aerospace giant 's assembly lines at a time when it has an $ N billion backlog of jetliner orders 
 the two sides were scheduled to meet with the mediator this morning 
 machinists already have rejected a package that would provide a N N pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract 
 boeing has said repeatedly it wo n't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer is n't good enough 
 however the resolve of some of the striking N machinists might be weakening 
 about N <unk> signed <unk> last week calling for boeing and machinists representatives to schedule new meetings 
 the two sides had n't met since oct. N 
 while boeing 's commercial business is booming its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the reagan presidency 
 in may the company consolidated its aerospace and electronics groups the new defense and space group will contain the aerospace and electronics division and advanced systems both based in the seattle area boeing <unk> in philadelphia boeing military airplanes in wichita kan. and <unk> in sunnyvale calif 
 b. dan <unk> president of boeing aerospace and electronics will become president of the new group which will become operational jan. N 
 in addition boeing said it also will <unk> all its work in wichita into military and commercial divisions 
 all of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations boeing said 
 analysts agreed 
 it 's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business said steven <unk> an analyst with bear stearns & co. in new york 
 they had to do it 
 howard <unk> an analyst with <unk> lawrence morgan grenfell inc. in new york said the shift reflects boeing confidence in mr. <unk> described by mr. <unk> as an expert on doing business with the military 
 his side of the business has been successful in a tough environment mr. <unk> said 
 a two-day meeting of representatives of cocom the <unk> group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries did n't take any <unk> decisions on trimming the list of items under controls 
 nor did it ease restrictions on exports to poland and hungary according to u.s. officials who attended the talks 
 the u.s. had been under pressure from several cocom members especially france west germany and italy to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools which those countries argued were now widely available to east bloc countries from <unk> members 
 for several years some european countries have complained that <unk> cocom lists and restrictions served more to <unk> their trade than to add to western security 
 some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for hungary and poland as they move toward more democratic rule just as special treatment had been agreed on for china 
 but u.s. officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was a matter for further discussion at future meetings 
 they added that all of us cocom members look at the changes in hungary and poland in a positive way but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study 
 the officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating china as a special case despite the recent repression of dissent there but to offer no further concessions 
 the u.s. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in eastern europe and the soviet union all the cocom members agreed on the continuing need for this organization which was founded N years ago at the start of the cold war 
 the officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward streamlining cocom 's restricted products list and to improve procedures for <unk> companies that do n't comply with the export restrictions 
 the officials said this meeting put in motion procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter 
 unisys corp. 's announcement friday of a $ N million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year 
 at the same time the sheer size of the loss coupled with a slowing of orders made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and <unk> concern 
 unisys is getting clobbered 
 just clobbered said <unk> weil an analyst at weil & associates who had once been high on the company 
 the quarter was terrible and the future looks anything but encouraging 
 unisys whose revenue inched up N N in the quarter to $ N billion from $ N billion in the year-earlier quarter had an operating loss of about $ N million 
 on top of that the blue bell pa. concern took a $ N million charge related to the layoffs of N employees 
 that is at the high end of the range of N to N employees that unisys said a month ago would be laid off 
 unisys said that should help it save $ N million a year in costs again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ N million to $ N million 
 the company also took a write-off of $ N million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that <unk> business 
 in addition unisys set up an unspecified reserve apparently $ N million to $ N million to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the <unk> scandal 
 unisys also noted that it paid $ N million in taxes during the quarter even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss 
 the tax payments will leave unisys with $ N million in loss <unk> that will cut tax payments in future quarters 
 in addition unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ N million during the quarter leaving it within $ N million of its goal of a reduction of $ N million by the end of the year 
 still unisys said its european business was weak during the quarter a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the u.s. over the past several quarters 
 the company also reported slower growth in another important business systems that use the unix operating system 
 that would be a huge problem if it were to continue because unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems mainly unix that work on almost anyone 's machines 
 in addition unisys must deal with its increasingly <unk> debt load 
 debt has risen to around $ N billion or about N N of total capitalization 
 that means unisys must pay about $ N million in interest every quarter on top of $ N million in dividends on preferred stock 
 jim <unk> unisys 's president said he is approaching next year with caution 
 he said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards 
 he also said that the price wars <unk> up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year 
 he said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down 
 that he said is why unisys is <unk> its whole business it needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to 
 we 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through mr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> industry is still going to be a <unk> business and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company 
 but we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term 
 securities analysts were even more cautious having been burned repeatedly on unisys this year 
 some had predicted earnings of more than $ N a share for this year up from last year 's fully diluted $ N a share on earnings of $ N million 
 but the company said friday that it had losses of $ N million through the first nine months compared with earnings a year earlier of $ N million or $ N a share fully diluted as revenue inched up N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 and unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter 
 so steve <unk> at first boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ N a share from $ N 
 i was feeling like i was too high to begin with he said 
 mr. weil of weil & associates said he will remain at $ N a share for next year but said he <unk> whether even that low target is at risk 
 the break-even point for next year is much lower but is it low enough he asked 
 reflecting the concern unisys stock fell a further N cents to $ N in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange 
 if a tv <unk> gets <unk> facing the camera again after a questionable forecast donald h. straszheim surely understands 
 the chief economist of merrill lynch & co. finds himself in such a position as he <unk> the midwest on his first road trip since <unk> on a major prediction 
 mr. straszheim expects he will take some heat and he 's right 
 since the last time he traveled this way several months ago he has <unk> a series of bold forecasts of a recession 
 in february N for example merrill lynch 's weekly commentary announced that the economy is likely to fall into recession in early N 
 the forecasts were widely <unk> and in a <unk> ad campaign launched in the summer of N merrill lynch urged investors to buy bonds 
 it said long-term interest rates then above N N could drop to N N by the end of N so bonds which benefit from falling rates would be a good buy 
 the firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from N N to N N and later to N N 
 but this september just when many market economists including some at merrill lynch believed that mr. straszheim was about to be proved right he took a <unk> if not a <unk> 
 he <unk> the talk about a recession 
 now in fact he is predicting economic growth of N N this year and N N next year a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top <unk> surveyed by blue chip economic indicators newsletter 
 and just recently merrill lynch cut the recommended <unk> back to N N 
 while such changes might sound minor they are n't merrill lynch manages or oversees some $ N billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities 
 two well-known colleagues who believe mr. straszheim was right the first time are david <unk> jr. and a. gary <unk> both of whom run their own new york research firms 
 mr. <unk> said in august that his <unk> index signaled recession 
 mr. <unk> who was merrill lynch 's chief economist from N to N has <unk> a recession for months 
 my own personal opinion is that don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet he says 
 now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy 
 and mr. straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that it may prove to be the case that we got <unk> that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time 
 he adds that 's the forecasting business 
 however risky the business it 's brisk these days 
 <unk> by bosses brokers clients and media people and pushed by their own <unk> wall street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the <unk> monthly indicator 
 but the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made <unk> of more than one forecast 
 this is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities 
 this is the commercial version 
 carrying the new message on the road mr. straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in <unk> proportion to the size of the client 
 no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time 
 some smaller clients do n't seem to notice his switch 
 but with some clients the talk can heat up a bit 
 dennis o'brien the treasurer of commonwealth edison co. in chicago <unk> a <unk> approach waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast 
 a good half-hour into breakfast at the palmer house mr. o'brien looks up from his plate after mr. straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to <unk> 
 i 'm one of them who hope they will with $ N billion in debt on the books 
 is that the forecast mr. o'brien asks trying to <unk> down the economist 
 he does n't fully succeed although mr. straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios 
 in a <unk> conference room at alliance capital management in minneapolis in contrast the firm 's money managers seem ready to <unk> mr. straszheim to the wall 
 alfred harrison the manager <unk> mr. straszheim 's <unk> back at him do we want to go through this 
 or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it 's about to be right 
 <unk> in his chair mr. straszheim replies that the new outlook though still weak does n't justify calling a recession right now 
 it 's all in this <unk> you do n't want to look at 
 we could still have a recession at some point 
 one of mr. straszheim 's <unk> themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white 
 sometimes like now it 's gray 
 this <unk> assessment moves one alliance portfolio manager to ask so what is this a <unk> recession 
 another challenges merrill lynch 's bond recommendation last year 
 we 're not running that ad campaign any more mr. straszheim <unk> in a rare show of <unk> 
 he adds i think it was a fairly decent call 
 explaining his change of mind mr. straszheim says later it 's hard to <unk> this on one factor 
 he says the economy and especially the employment numbers look much better than he expected interest rates have generally declined inflation has n't run <unk> 
 our business is constantly looking at all these things he says 
 his new forecast calls for a soft landing 
 and it may be right judging from last week 's report that inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a N N annual rate in the third quarter 
 mr. <unk> understands mr. straszheim 's problems 
 there 's <unk> pressure on economists to forecast these numbers he says 
 you make a forecast and then you become its prisoner 
 it is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast and mr. straszheim is <unk> with the <unk> on this trip 
 his approach to the <unk> is direct but <unk> 
 for some time we had forecast negative third and fourth-quarter growth 
 we pulled that forecast he begins <unk> in a meeting with <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc. officials in minneapolis the first stop 
 crane co. said it holds an N N stake in milton roy corp. an <unk> maker and may seek control of the company 
 crane a maker of engineered products for aerospace construction defense and other uses made the disclosure in a securities and exchange commission filing

 last week the british displayed unusual political <unk> 
 the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned because prime minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir alan walters 
 the opposition labor party leader neil <unk> in a display of the male <unk> typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to <unk> the men in her cabinet 
 the british press making a mountain out of a <unk> <unk> an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying mrs. thatcher as an <unk> who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government 
 behind the silly <unk> lies a real dispute 
 mr. lawson and his <unk> colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark 
 sir alan considers this an <unk> and costly policy 
 as there is an effort to <unk> the dollar either to gold or other currencies the dispute is worth <unk> 
 until his resignation mr. lawson had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark 
 when mrs. thatcher cut the top tax rate to N N mr. lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark 
 as a result he <unk> the inflation that mrs. thatcher through a long and costly effort had subdued 
 with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark 
 to keep the exchange rate pegged mr. lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to N N 
 this doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that mrs. thatcher 's policies had created producing widespread <unk> and pushing labor ahead in the polls 
 instead of <unk> his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both british economic policy and mrs. thatcher 's political fortune mr. lawson pushed for <unk> the pound formally to the mark by entering the european monetary system which subordinates all member currencies to german monetary policy 
 this put mrs. thatcher in a <unk> 
 the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the <unk> but are full of practical <unk> 
 if the pound had been tied to the mark the british would have been unable to cut their <unk> tax rates 
 the reason is simple 
 when a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency 
 it was fear of disturbing ems exchange-rate relationships that caused the <unk> government in france to be <unk> about cutting tax rates 
 <unk> <unk> the finance minister at the time was sold on the <unk> policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as <unk> for disturbing the linked european currency relationship 
 the price of attracting capital whether one 's own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit 
 to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise 
 this <unk> policy could not prevent a british trade deficit 
 consequently mr. lawson <unk> mrs. thatcher with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates three political failures in a row 
 little wonder that mrs. thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office 
 it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by <unk> the pound 
 the british <unk> statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to N N the flow abroad of british capital slowed to N billion pounds $ N billion at the current rate in N from N billion pounds in N 
 this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by <unk> the currency 
 nigel lawson was a victim of the <unk> confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s 
 the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead <unk> financial flows in response to high interest rates 
 this has led them in a <unk> and <unk> policy circle 
 first comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by <unk> reduction 
 then when the currency falls interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate 
 this policy is totally <unk> and sir alan is correct to point out its deficiencies 
 britain and all of europe need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and <unk> of germany 
 a unified germany that remained within the western alliance would give germany such an <unk> position that all other members of a unified europe would become <unk> of the german state 
 unless the soviet union <unk> german reunification is likely to require germany 's <unk> 
 the implications for britain france and the rest of europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge mr. lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate 
 in the least we must recognize the <unk> of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of <unk> reduction on capital flows

 personal spending which fueled the economy 's growth in the third quarter was clearly slowing by the end of the period raising questions about the economy 's strength as the year ends 
 personal spending grew N N in september to a $ N trillion annual rate the commerce department said 
 it was the smallest monthly increase in a year 
 at the same time personal income was held down by the effects of hurricane hugo which <unk> through parts of north and south carolina in late september 
 the department said personal income rose N N in september to a $ N trillion rate but would have climbed N N had it not been for the storm 
 among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income 
 the figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled u.s. economic expansion in the third quarter while on an inflation-adjusted basis business investment slowed government spending declined and exports were flat 
 but the new statistics show that by september the burst in spending seemed to be <unk> off 
 many economists expect the weakness to continue 
 i think the consumer has pretty well played himself out said david <unk> senior economist at manufacturers national bank of detroit 
 i do n't think there 's a lot in the wings in other sectors of the economy to keep growth above N N he said 
 in the third quarter the economy grew at a moderate N N annual rate 
 in august personal income rose N N and spending grew N N 
 analysts have attributed much of the summer 's <unk> in spending to bargain car prices at the end of the model year 
 car sales <unk> in september after the N models were introduced 
 according to the commerce department report spending on durable goods items expected to last at least three years including cars declined by $ N billion 
 the nation 's savings rate was unchanged in september at N N of after-tax income far below the N N it reached in july 
 all the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations 
 here is the commerce department 's latest report on personal income 
 the figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in <unk> of dollars

 moreover the company whose <unk> approach nearly proved fatal now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls the data solutions business 
 i 'm not saying everything is <unk> but we have completed the transition robert m. price chairman and chief executive said in an interview 
 transition is a reference to the company 's five-year restructuring effort 
 during that time control data had losses of more than $ N billion 
 now following asset sales that shrank revenue by more than one-third this year alone control data is flush with cash 
 so its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company 's $ N million in subordinated convertible debentures next year 
 we 'd like to continue to reduce debt president lawrence perlman said 
 noting that the company is offering to buy back $ N million in senior notes paying N N N he said the response will help determine future <unk> efforts 
 the offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of control data 's <unk> disk-drive business to seagate technology inc 
 mr. perlman who is also acting chief financial officer and the <unk> favorite to become the next chief executive said the company is <unk> modest positive cash flow from operations and we expect that to continue into N 
 he said the company has no intention of <unk> its short-term bank lines for a good part of N 
 sometime next year control data will develop a new bank relationship mr. perlman said 
 in recent months a group of lenders led by bank of america has extended control data up to $ N million in revolving loans through january as well as $ N million in <unk> letters of credit 
 loan <unk> require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling <unk> profitability test 
 last week control data reported third-quarter earnings of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million 
 through the first nine months the company had a loss of $ N million largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit 
 while a few assets are still being <unk> including the sports and entertainment <unk> portion of the company 's <unk> unit mr. price said future restructuring would be a question of strategy 
 we do n't need the cash 
 <unk> 's automated <unk> business which operates <unk> in a half dozen states is not for sale the company said 
 rather mr. perlman said control data intends to bid for the coming minnesota <unk> contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas where there is great interest in games of <unk> 
 he would n't elaborate 
 control data 's semiconductor business <unk> inc. continues to lose money the executives acknowledged but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to <unk> of it 
 the company 's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses 
 partly costs will be held down through strategic technology alliances management said 
 control data recently announced an agreement with mips computer systems inc. to jointly develop machines with <unk> operating software 
 james e. <unk> computer products group president said such arrangements could help slash control data 's computer research and development costs in half by the end of N 
 he disclosed that before control data scrapped its <unk> systems inc. supercomputer business this past spring those costs were running at nearly N N of group revenue 
 at the same time four of six design projects were <unk> he said 
 asked how the company hopes to expand its computer hardware business mr. <unk> said it sees good opportunities in systems integration 
 we think we 're getting only N N of the integration dollars our customers are spending he said 
 we 're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that 
 control data mainframes are designed for <unk> intensive computing users such as the scientific engineering and academic communities 
 utilities management is a major commercial niche 
 reviewing the company 's <unk> with disaster mr. price conceded it had tried to do too much on its own 
 absolutely he said 
 but while its stock is selling at about half control data 's estimated breakup value neither messrs. perlman nor price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover 
 we 've been listed as a candidate for so long it 's not worth worrying about said mr. price 
 well the arrogant east coast media have spoken again going for the green editorial oct. N 
 having <unk> in the great state of california for the past seven years i find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when i start my commute to work with eyes <unk> and head <unk> from the <unk> air when i try to enjoy the <unk> and come home covered with <unk> and oil when i hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of <unk> and use of chemicals in fruit growing 
 perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists suggesting that their <unk> initiatives are <unk> and referring to so many citizens as <unk> activists 
 strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the east coast activists who seek to clean up boston harbor or rid their <unk> of medical waste 
 while there are no easy low-cost solutions simply ignoring our problems will result in their <unk> increasing and spreading throughout the state the nation and the world 
 if nothing else such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate <unk> action 
 before your next <unk> editorial please spend more time out here <unk> the situation it just may change your view 
 john barry <unk> calif 
 i realize you were just looking for something <unk> to say about california and its environmental movement but picking frank lloyd wright to say it for you was a bad call 
 wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen <unk> to the environment decades before it became fashionable among <unk> activists 
 indeed wright said all his life that the greatest <unk> he learned were derived from the study of nature 
 obviously it 's lost on you that about N N of the american people these days and in fact the president of the united states consider themselves environmentalists 
 as for california being a state run by liberal environmental <unk> let 's not forget where ronald reagan came from 
 perhaps mr. reagan who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees is the man you should be <unk> to back up your position that economics is more important than the earth 
 but it was frank lloyd wright who said is this not <unk> 
 the <unk> that knows no god but more 
 robert <unk> santa <unk> calif 
 your editorial was <unk> and neatly matched by the readers ' comments in letters to the editor <unk> scaring on the side of caution 
 the <unk> and <unk> of john h. adams 's comments for the national resources defense council fully justifies your <unk> of california 's greens in particular as <unk> activists 
 we may all hope that california 's voters will <unk> the scientific realities that their own university 's <unk> prof. tom <unk> provides them and ignore the <unk> <unk> by their wealthy hollywood <unk> 
 i have a different approach to offer not only to californians but to all americans 
 in a free country the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good <unk> and public safety 
 would-be <unk> should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law

 the commission said that ec television producers lost important market shares and suffered an <unk> pressure on prices because of the korean companies ' marketing and pricing policies which it said were in clear violation of international trade rules 
 in other news concerning south korea 's television industry <unk> signed an agreement with <unk> the <unk> organization of the soviet union to swap korean television sets and videocassette recorders for <unk> iron from the soviet union 
 south korea and the soviet union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year

 if this battle were a movie the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common 
 in the <unk> sony corp. would agree to buy columbia pictures entertainment inc. in a transaction valued at close to $ N billion 
 shortly after that sony would offer to buy guber-peters entertainment co. for $ N million and offer its <unk> peter guber and jon peters the chance to run columbia 
 mr. peters would fly to new york with the intention of telling warner communications inc. chairman steven j. ross that guber-peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for warner 
 that 's where the two scripts would <unk> 
 in affidavits filed in los angeles superior court in connection with the $ N billion <unk> suit warner brought against sony for hiring the two producers mr. guber and mr. peters tell one story 
 warner tells another 
 in the affidavits mr. peters says he was shocked when mr. ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them 
 mr. peters claims he reminded mr. ross that robert daly and terry semel the top executives of the warner brothers studio had repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept an offer such as sony 's 
 in response mr. peters says mr. ross referred to his colleagues at warner with an <unk> and said tell them that they do n't have a job 
 you can take them with you 
 warner denies mr. ross ever said any such thing and in fact denies virtually everything mr. guber and mr. peters say in their affidavits 
 tomorrow warner will file another batch of documents <unk> that the <unk> of everything these guys are saying is basically lies says warner 's chief outside counsel stuart <unk> 
 thursday a judge is scheduled to rule on warner 's motion seeking to block the guber-peters duo from going to columbia 
 the battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a <unk> into the inner workings of this hollywood <unk> 
 but they also make it clear that the first thing a judge will have to decide is which if any version of events in this <unk> is <unk> and which fact 
 the matter may never even be tried in court 
 warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their <unk> obligations but the <unk> of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the <unk> relationship between warner and its two most <unk> producers can ever be repaired 
 warner which is in the process of <unk> with time warner inc. says it is willing to settle the matter out of court 
 so far however sony has n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands 
 mr. guber and mr. peters do n't have much to gain from a <unk> battle 
 sony for its part could decide that the cost of a warner settlement or court fight is too high choosing instead to find someone else to run columbia although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to mr. guber and mr. peters 
 in that case mr. guber and mr. peters might not suffer financially but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably <unk> relationship with warner 
 at the center of any court fight will be the <unk> <unk> of the written contract between warner and the two producers but other <unk> issues will play a big role 
 sony and the guber-peters team are hanging much of their case on warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up 
 warner denies such an agreement was made and disputes the guber-peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter 
 just how <unk> the relationship has become is clear from the <unk> versions of the two sides ' current business dealings 
 mr. guber and mr. peters say in their affidavits that warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at warner notably the <unk> <unk> film <unk> and cash 
 mr. peters says in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that warner was taking over the picture and another producer would be giving all of the orders 
 over his objections mr. peters says the film 's release date was moved up by many months to december and plans for a <unk> worth millions of dollars were dropped 
 <unk> de la <unk> an editor on the film backs mr. peters in a separate sworn declaration 
 mr. de la <unk> says warner brothers production president mark canton called him oct. N and said mr. peters is off the picture 
 if he calls you up just tell him everything is fine 
 the editor also says the new producer on the film bruce <unk> told editors to screen the picture without telling stars <unk> <unk> and kurt russell or mr. peters 
 the less they know the easier it is for us 
 if someone asks just lie and tell them it will be done mr. de la <unk> says mr. <unk> told them 
 that says warner 's mr. <unk> is a total N N lie 
 the movie he says is in its <unk> stages of cleaning up the film 
 he says mr. peters and mr. guber as the <unk> producers with <unk> rights have been invited to <unk> and to give their input on the film 
 dozens of guber-peters staffers are still working on the warner lot and consulting on various projects on a daily basis the attorney says 
 mr. guber in his affidavit says that when he advised warner president terry semel of the sony offer at lunch on sept. N mr. semel <unk> and <unk> me and expressed <unk> that we had finally realized our long-term <unk> of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company 
 mr. guber says he brought to lunch a release document warner had agreed to in N when he and mr. peters made an aborted bid to buy part of mgm\/ua entertainment co. to run the mgm studio 
 mr. guber says he had crossed out mgm with a red <unk> and written in columbia giving the document to mr. semel 
 mr. semel said absolutely nothing to indicate warner would have any <unk> to our assuming management positions at columbia mr. guber says 
 mr. semel in his affidavit does n't mention any <unk> or <unk> 
 he says he told mr. guber he could n't sign any documents and that the deal although apparently a good one for him and mr. peters would have a very negative impact on warner 
 he said he would contact mr. ross and warner brothers chairman robert daly and that in a conference call the three agreed they could n't let the producers out of their contract 
 mr. ross in his own affidavit says he and mr. daly instructed mr. semel to tell the producers warner would n't terminate their agreement 
 mr. guber says that mr. semel did convey that information and that mr. semel said mr. ross was crazy because of the time deal meaning mr. guber says that mr. ross did not want to <unk> to his new merger partner time inc. that warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances 
 mr. guber also says in his affidavit that mr. daly told us that even if sony did not want us warner 's relationship with us already was <unk> damaged that there was no way to put the egg together and that it would sue sony for tons of money 
 moreover mr. guber claims mr. semel told him that mr. ross probably would n't object if it were anybody other than sony 
 but sony is a problem 
 the guber-peters side has said warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the u.s. entertainment business 
 some in hollywood suggest mr. guber and mr. peters took encouragement from warner studio executives such as mr. semel and mr. canton too literally 
 according to this theory warner executives hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers encouraged mr. guber and mr. peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company 
 but the warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract 
 mr. <unk> the warner attorney says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract 
 they are like a <unk> they have N projects in development for warner he says 
 but mr. guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used 
 for example he says that since N he and mr. peters have developed over N movie projects and warner has passed or chosen not to produce at least N 
 as for the projects remaining at warner mr. guber says mr. semel informed me that warner 's producers have already started a feeding frenzy for our projects

 despite politicians ' <unk> about the federal budget the government ended fiscal N with a $ N billion deficit about the same as the two previous years 
 even white house budget director richard darman had trouble finding a silver <unk> in the report 
 i <unk> you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up he said but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not 
 the federal deficit was $ N billion in N and $ N billion in N 
 the N deficit would have been nearly $ N billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on sept. N 
 because the resolution trust corp could n't spend the money fast enough the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal N 
 nevertheless the N deficit still exceeded the $ N billion target set by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law by $ N billion a reminder of that law 's <unk> 
 the law sets a deficit target of $ N billion for fiscal N 
 a <unk> fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of N deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the gramm-rudman law 
 the white house and the democratic leadership in congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year 
 neither side showed any sign of retreating 
 meeting with reporters friday mr. darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the house which would increase spending in future years 
 <unk> the size of the deficits of the past few years the treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt $ N billion exceeded spending on social security the single largest government program 
 in all federal outlays amounted to $ N trillion in N up N N from the previous year the treasury said 
 federal revenues rose N N to $ N billion 
 the treasury said a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared 
 the treasury marked up its forecast by $ N million in july but that proved to be about $ N billion too optimistic 
 the government ran a deficit of $ N billion in september compared with a surplus of $ N billion in september N 
 outlays for the month totaled $ N billion up from $ N billion a year earlier 
 the increase reflects spending on the s&l rescue as well as payroll and social security checks normally issued in october that were issued in september this year because oct. N fell on a sunday 
 revenues were $ N billion up from $ N billion a year earlier 
 cms energy corp. said it would begin paying a <unk> quarterly dividend the company 's first since N

 cms is nearly done converting the midland plant to a <unk> <unk> facility at a cost of $ N million 
 cms management said thursday that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met friday 
 the dividend will be paid nov. N to shares of record nov. N 
 the company suffered a loss of $ N million in N but its financial situation has been improving since then 
 humana inc. said it expects to receive about $ N million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute 
 the health-care company said it expects the refund to be included in the first quarter ending nov. N 
 the refund is about $ N million 
 accrued interest on the refund was about $ N million as of oct. N 
 the refund stems from a court ruling that found certain payments by humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal N through N were deductible as premiums for liability insurance 
 polly peck international inc. 's agreement to acquire N N of sansui electric co. proves that foreign companies can acquire japanese companies if the alternative for the japanese company is <unk> 
 polly peck a fast-growing british conglomerate will pay N billion yen $ N million for N million new shares of sansui a well-known maker of <unk> audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions 
 japanese government officials eager to <unk> foreign criticism of japanese investments overseas hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in japan 
 polly peck 's chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> the official japanese view of the accord which was announced friday 
 the <unk> that japan is not open to concerns from outside has i think been <unk> at a <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 but analysts say sansui is a special case 
 it expects to post a loss of N billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about N billion yen 
 if you find sound healthy companies in japan they are not for sale said george <unk> a <unk> at tokyo-based asia advisory services inc 
 statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail because unlike sansui which is listed on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges most of the japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held 
 but by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of japanese companies this year while japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies 
 nor do analysts expect the sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases 
 if the strong yen and the high stock prices of japanese companies were n't <unk> enough <unk> of <unk> between friendly japanese companies and fiercely independent japanese corporate attitudes <unk> most would-be <unk> 
 usually when a japanese company is ready to sell it has few alternatives remaining and the grim <unk> of sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's <unk> hour 
 sansui was once one of japan 's premier makers of expensive high-quality stereo gear for <unk> 
 but in recent years the market has moved toward less expensive <unk> sets <unk> <unk> and <unk> and software players that could be <unk> on top of each other 
 some of sansui 's fellow <unk> companies such as <unk> co. and pioneer electric corp. responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out <unk> products of their own by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other <unk> fields including laser disks or portable <unk> players 
 sansui was late into the <unk> business and failed to branch into other new businesses 
 as the yen soared in recent years sansui 's <unk> financial problems became a vicious circle 
 while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories sansui lacked the money to build new plants in southeast asia 
 our company has not been able to cope very effectively with changes in the marketplace said <unk> <unk> sansui 's president 
 but even a japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern some management consultants maintain 
 <unk> <unk> a management consultant for <unk> & hamilton japan inc. said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future 
 attitudes toward being acquired are still negative but they 're becoming more positive mr. <unk> said 
 in some industries like pharmaceuticals acquisitions make sense 
 whether polly peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen but at the news conference mr. <unk> <unk> with <unk> that he can turn sansui around 
 sansui he said is a perfect fit for polly peck 's electronics operations which make <unk> videocassette recorders <unk> and other products on an original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies ' brand names 
 he said polly peck will greatly expand sansui 's product line using sansui 's engineers to design the new products and will move sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into polly peck 's own factories 
 whatever capital it sansui needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world that capital will be <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 and while polly peck is n't <unk> the <unk> <unk> structure of sansui it is bringing in a former toshiba corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer 
 such risk taking is an everyday matter for the <unk> mr. <unk> who is N N owner of polly peck as well as its chairman

 <unk> s. <unk> in london contributed to this article 
 the bolstered cellular agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin broadcasting corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off mccaw cellular communications inc. the rival suitor for lin 
 moreover the amended pact shows how mccaw 's <unk> has pushed lin and bellsouth into a corner forcing huge debt on the proposed new company 
 the debt estimated at $ N billion could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to <unk> some lin holders in the short term 
 the plan still calls for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bellsouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations 
 but under new terms of the agreement announced friday lin holders would receive a special cash dividend of $ N a share representing a payout of about $ N billion shortly before the proposed merger 
 lin said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained 
 under previous terms holders would have received a dividend of only $ N a share 
 in addition new york-based lin would exercise its right to buy out for $ N billion the N N equity interest of its partner metromedia co. in a new york cellular franchise 
 that money also would have to be borrowed 
 in effect mccaw has forced lin 's hand by bidding $ N billion for the stake earlier this month 
 we 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to acknowledged michael <unk> lin 's vice president and treasurer 
 although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until N or later 
 analyst estimate the value of the bellsouth proposal at about $ N to $ N a share 
 they value mccaw 's bid at $ N to $ N a share 
 the previous bellsouth pact was valued at about $ N to $ N a share 
 mccaw the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the u.s. already owns about N N of lin 's stock 
 in response to bellsouth 's amended pact the <unk> wash. company extended its own offer to buy N million lin shares for $ N apiece which would give mccaw a N N controlling interest 
 over the weekend mccaw continued to call for an auction of lin 
 analysts said they expect mccaw to <unk> the bidding again 
 this game is n't over yet said joel d. gross a vice president at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 at some point it will become <unk> for one company 
 but i do n't think we 're at that point yet 
 under its revised proposal atlanta-based bellsouth would have a N N interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt 
 to <unk> the pact further and to ease concerns of institutional investors bellsouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company 
 the provision described as <unk> protection would require bellsouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay 
 mccaw 's bid also has a similar clause 
 only mccaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in june N for remaining shares at <unk> prices 
 to <unk> shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the <unk> agreement bellsouth also agreed to pay as much as $ N a share or $ N million if after five years the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the mccaw offer 
 we 're very pleased with the new deal 
 we did n't expect bellsouth to be so responsive said frederick a. <unk> president of <unk> asset management inc. which holds N lin shares 
 bellsouth 's <unk> protection was flawed previously 
 we think this is a superior deal to mccaw 's 
 we 're surprised 
 we did n't think a sleeping bell mentality would be willing to take on <unk> 
 but kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst with bear stearns & co. finds the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more lin shares 
 how many shares will be around in N he asked 
 there 's nothing preventing bellsouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile 
 bellsouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some <unk> of future earnings 
 william o. <unk> president of the company 's bellsouth enterprises inc. unit said the revised agreement with lin would <unk> bellsouth earnings by about N N in both N and N and by significantly less thereafter 
 indeed bellsouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable 
 for N bellsouth earned $ N billion or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 analysts were predicting N bellsouth earnings in the range of $ N a share or $ N billion but now those estimates are being scaled back 
 in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange bellsouth shares fell N cents to $ N 
 in national over-the-counter trading lin shares soared $ N to closed at $ N while mccaw fell $ N a share to $ N 
 the proposed <unk> cellular company including the newly acquired metromedia stake would give the new entity N million potential customers including about N million in the nation 's top N markets 
 mr. leon of bear stearns speculated that mccaw in an attempt to buy time might consider filing an antitrust suit against bellsouth with the justice department and u.s. district judge harold greene who oversees enforcement of the consent <unk> that broke up the bell system in N 
 indeed mccaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement 
 urging lin directors to conduct a fair auction on a level playing field mccaw asked how well the public interest would be served with the bell operating companies controlling over N N of all cellular potential customers in the nation 's top N markets 
 market makers in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading 
 their <unk> however has a strong practical aspect program trading is hazardous to their <unk> 
 the most controversial form of program trading stock-index arbitrage is making it tough for traders to make money declares robert <unk> head of otc trading at donaldson lufkin & jenrette 
 stock-index arbitrage the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies affects the otc market directly through the N stocks included in standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 the s&p N is often used in arbitrage strategies 
 the portion of otc volume attributable to program trading is n't known as it is on the new york stock exchange where it amounted to more than N N in september 
 estimates from traders put it at less than N N of nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly N million shares 
 other <unk> <unk> program trading also causes the nasdaq composite index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market 
 because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many otc stocks without sharp price moves a condition known as <unk> 
 moreover the price volatility that is <unk> by program trading is <unk> efforts to woo individual investors back to an otc market that <unk> misses them 
 some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the otc market 
 but the big often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been <unk> from the practice against it 
 peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the <unk> bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising 
 we were n't as concerned until they became sell programs says mr. dapuzzo who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility 
 shearson lehman however <unk> program trades for clients 
 merrill lynch goldman sachs and kidder peabody in addition to shearson do <unk> otc stocks 
 shearson merrill lynch and goldman sachs say they do so only for customers however 
 kidder peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts 
 of course there were sell programs in past years too but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days 
 that 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the N crash when individual investors fled the market and trading activity <unk> 
 market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling 
 and to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further market makers became <unk> to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress 
 on days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will 
 in such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares 
 it makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose says mr. <unk> of donaldson lufkin 
 but this <unk> mr. <unk> says is creating liquidity problems in certain otc stocks 
 it 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to take the orders 
 no one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks 
 joseph <unk> president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees trading on nasdaq agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small investors 
 but he observes while makers suffer losses when program trading <unk> the market down they also make money when program trading <unk> the prices higher 
 sometimes traders lose sight of that he says 
 the otc stocks in the s&p N include nasdaq 's biggest such as apple computer mci communications tele-communications and <unk> <unk> 
 these big stocks greatly influence the nasdaq composite index 
 when the computers say sell the composite <unk> as well as the dow jones industrial average 
 the problem market makers say is that while the industrial average and the s&p N usually recover as buy programs kick in the nasdaq composite frequently is left behind 
 eight trading days after oct. N the day before the stock market plunge for instance the nasdaq composite had fallen N N compared with N N for the s&p N N N for the new york stock exchange composite index and N N for the industrial average 
 this gap eventually closes but slowly 
 three days later as of friday 's close the nasdaq composite was down N N compared with N N for the industrial average N N for the s&p N and N N for the big board composite 
 the main reason for this lag is that individual investors own N N of the otc market 's capitalization according to mr. <unk> much more than on the big board 
 such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about <unk> the market after massive <unk> market makers say

 london share prices closed sharply lower friday in active trading after chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 's resignation <unk> the market and wall street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down 
 london shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in new york and by the drop in sterling after mr. lawson 's resignation 
 it showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling but the weight of wall street late in london trading and signs of further weakness in the british pound proved a hefty load to bear

 the 30-share index settled N points lower at N 
 volume was N million shares up from N million thursday and the week 's most active session 
 dealers said the turnover largely confined to the 100-share index stocks partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a <unk> trading account and the start of a new account 
 but they said friday 's focus on the <unk> stocks <unk> active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the u.k. economy and britain 's currency in the wake of the upheaval in prime minister margaret thatcher 's cabinet 
 a senior dealer with warburg securities noted british gas the most active blue-chip stock at N million shares traded was affected by the political implications of mr. lawson 's departure and mrs. thatcher 's cabinet <unk>

 british gas shed N pence a share to close at N pence $ N 
 other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that london shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that mr. lawson 's successor john major had only been in the job one day

 frankfurt prices closed lower again friday the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the dax index lose N N 
 the dax dropped N points friday to N 
 traders said the continued turbulence in other markets coupled with the drop in london following the lawson resignation were responsible 
 traders said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the dax dropped friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest 
 they said contributing to the downward <unk> was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend 
 it 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us said <unk> von <unk> a trader at credit suisse first boston in frankfurt 
 if you take away the outside influences the market itself looks very cheap 
 what 's happening here is n't justified by the fundamentals 
 traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the new york stock exchange last week

 when michael s. <unk> took the <unk> at a recent cosmetics industry event more than N executives <unk> the room snapped to attention 
 mr. <unk> who runs unilever group 's world-wide <unk> business <unk> to <unk> the crowd 
 i see we have about half the audience working for us he said <unk> in <unk> 
 the other half we may have before long 
 members of the audience <unk> or <unk> nervously their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions 
 first unilever the <unk> packaged-goods giant spent $ N billion to acquire brands such as faberge and elizabeth <unk> 
 it now holds the no. N position at u.s. department-store cosmetic <unk> 
 then procter & gamble co. agreed to buy noxell corp. for $ N billion 
 that acquisition to be completed by year end will include the cover girl and <unk> makeup lines making p&g the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets 
 it 's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has <unk> the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring p&g and unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper <unk> <unk> in the <unk> cosmetics trade but they also bring <unk> marketing clout <unk> fear 
 though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling promise <unk> and tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry 
 for now both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans 
 but industry watchers expect them to <unk> the <unk> marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more <unk> approach typical of cosmetics companies 
 likely changes include more emphasis on research soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing 
 but some <unk> executives wonder whether techniques <unk> in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business 
 <unk> lauder inc. <unk> inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is <unk> by the creative <unk> of their executives 
 cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year and since most products can be easily <unk> by competitors they 're loath to test them with consumers 
 just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and <unk> like packaged goods it does n't mean they are packaged goods says leonard lauder chief executive of <unk> lauder 
 they 're really fashion items <unk> up in little <unk> 
 in contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses unilever and p&g are the <unk> of organization men in <unk> suits 
 both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research 
 p&g in particular rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive <unk> 
 both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as <unk> and <unk> to the extent that some industry consultants predict <unk> coupons for <unk> could result from their entry into the field 
 p&g already has shown it can <unk> some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the <unk> of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business 
 consider oil of <unk> which p&g acquired as part of <unk> international in N 
 the <unk> introduced in N had a <unk> image 
 oil of <unk> brought with it the <unk> of being used basically by older women who had already aged says david williams a consultant with new england consulting group 
 p&g set out to <unk> the brand by <unk> the product line to include <unk> <unk> and <unk> for sensitive skin 
 it also <unk> oil of <unk> 's packaging <unk> the traditional <unk> boxes with gold lines to create a more <unk> look 
 moreover p&g shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her <unk> <unk> not to grow old <unk> 
 the company says sales have soared 
 <unk> like unilever and p&g have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals 
 next year noxell plans to roll out a <unk> called navy says george l. <unk> jr. chairman of noxell 
 without p&g 's backing noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $ N million to $ N million needed to accomplish that without <unk> on its existing brands 
 packaged-goods companies will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive mr. <unk> says 
 further <unk> in the industry could follow 
 rumors that unilever is interested in acquiring schering-plough corp. 's <unk> unit are widespread 
 unilever wo n't comment <unk> however denies the brand is for sale 
 the presence of unilever and p&g is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics 
 while the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads 
 instead they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases 
 <unk> lauder for example spends only an estimated N N of sales on advertising in the u.s. and mr. lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy 
 the most dramatic changes however probably will come in <unk> development 
 nearly N N of cosmetics sales come through <unk> outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets according to andrew shore an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 that figure has been <unk> up for several years 
 as the trend continues demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only <unk> particularly <unk> products is expected to increase 
 this fall for example <unk> group ordinarily a high-end line rolled out a <unk> line of <unk> products called <unk> which retail for $ N to $ N 
 the packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products 
 unlike the <unk> cosmetics houses unilever and p&g both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products 
 p&g in fact is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition 
 sales of its tide detergent soared earlier this year for example after p&g introduced a version that includes a <unk> safe for all colors and <unk> 
 that 's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion <unk> especially among mass-market brands 
 there will be more emphasis on quality says guy <unk> chief executive of <unk> inc. the u.s. <unk> of <unk> 
 you 'll see fewer <unk> 
 but success for unilever and p&g is far from guaranteed as shown by the many <unk> companies that have tried and failed to master the <unk> beauty business 
 in the 1970s several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies including colgate-palmolive co. eli lilly & co. pfizer inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies 
 industry consultants say only schering-plough which makes the mass-market <unk> has maintained a meaningful business 
 colgate which acquired <unk> <unk> in N sold the brand seven years later after the brand <unk> 
 unilever already has experienced some disappointment 
 the mass-market <unk> brand which it acquired in N along with <unk> 's inc. has lost share according to industry analysts 
 the <unk> world of department-store cosmetics retailing where unilever is concentrating its efforts may prove even more <unk> 
 in this niche makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to <unk> <unk> 
 because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are <unk> careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important 
 and <unk> a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $ N for <unk> or eye makeup requires a <unk> touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own 
 there may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the white house and congress over how this country <unk> secret intelligence operations abroad 
 after years of <unk> born of <unk> past <unk> of the central intelligence agency and the iran-contra scandal president bush and the senate intelligence committee appear ready for now at least to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities 
 if that attitude lasts it could <unk> covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years 
 over the past week the president has agreed to keep the committee informed usually in advance of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing 
 that was n't always the way the reagan administration handled such matters 
 mr. bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring u.s. agents from <unk> foreign leaders or helping others to do so 
 congress never fully trusted former cia chief william <unk> and national security adviser john <unk> to honor the ban 
 despite objections by the cia mr. bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the cia who would be independent of the cia director 
 in return the senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within N hours of the launching of any covert activity 
 it also has removed a ban on cia use of a <unk> fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some <unk> and <unk> restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the cia did n't get back in the assassination game 
 we 've finally been able to convince them that <unk> and oliver north do n't work here anymore says one administration official 
 the new understanding did n't just spring to life in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and light 
 it emerged after a <unk> display of <unk> intelligence politics that followed this month 's failed coup attempt in panama 
 the white house used television appearances and leaks to argue that <unk> imposed restrictions on covert actions made u.s. support for such coups difficult 
 mr. bush even disclosed privately that one <unk> deal with congress required him to notify the <unk> panamanian dictator manuel noriega if the u.s. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life 
 the president also hinted he might veto this year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive 
 intelligence committee chairman david boren d. <unk> and vice chairman william cohen r. maine for their part <unk> accused the white house of <unk> <unk> classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to congress for the <unk> attempt to topple gen. noriega 
 the white house got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative republicans who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities 
 instead mr. bush and his aides made it clear they respected congress 's role and felt they could work with the conservative mr. boren and the moderate mr. cohen to iron out their differences 
 the senators responded in kind 
 sen. boren <unk> told reporters that there had been a meeting of the minds with the white house and that the committee had given mr. bush a clean slate free of the <unk> imposed during the reagan years 
 sen. cohen said the relationship has <unk> to its <unk> character 
 there still are some details to be <unk> down 
 mr. bush is <unk> the right in rare <unk> to keep congress in the dark <unk> a constitutional <unk> the committee does n't recognize 
 and a pending justice department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled 
 moreover both sides may face political critics 
 some conservatives will accuse the president of promising congress too much 
 and they continue <unk> attacking cia director william webster for being too <unk> to the committee 
 at the same time some congressional liberals will accuse sens. boren and cohen of <unk> out and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of nicaraguan harbors and the iran arms sales 
 but if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater <unk> on covert activities the country could be entering an era when such <unk> schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards while risky but <unk> secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a <unk> congress will <unk> 
 several of the new york stock exchange 's own listed companies led by giant contel corp. are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it 
 claiming program trading has turned the big board into a gambling casino contel chairman charles wohlstetter said that he and at least N other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance 
 the group mr. wohlstetter said in an interview wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on <unk> program-trading strategies 
 the group will complain to washington to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the big board itself he said 
 they should call the exchange trump east charged mr. wohlstetter the <unk> founder of contel who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader 
 what is the mission of the financial community 
 to help some <unk> or <unk> or help corporate america 
 contel is a $ N billion telephone and electronics company 
 pressure has been building on the big board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility which many investors say is caused by program trading 
 the market 's friday-the-13th plunge of N points in the dow jones industrial average and the big board 's <unk> response to it galvanized some longstanding <unk> among companies listed on the exchange 
 last month program trading accounted for a record N N of average daily big board volume 
 mr. wohlstetter for example said he wrote to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. about program trading after the 190-point dow plunge and as in previous <unk> what i get back is <unk> 
 he said he 's upset that mr. phelan trying to calm investors after the plunge said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings 
 the big board is partly to blame for the price swings because they 're <unk> said mr. wohlstetter 
 their powerful members manage them 
 the focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on 
 index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets but critics say such trading <unk> market movements and increases the chance for a crash 
 the big board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading 
 richard <unk> big board president last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents 
 privately exchange officials worry that without a <unk> system for program trading at the big board billions of dollars in trading will simply <unk> to overseas exchanges such as london 's 
 it is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock basket product that allows big investors to buy or sell all N stocks in the standard & poor 's index in a single trade 
 one intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers according to the exchange 
 investors have complained for some time about program trading particularly index arbitrage to little <unk> 
 but according to some big board traders an organized campaign from <unk> companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes 
 they wo n't fight the listed companies 
 now the assault is on said one top trader 
 the big board ca n't ban stock-index futures of course but it could ban use of its <unk> electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off 
 the exchange put a bit of a <unk> on program trading when last year it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm 's program-trading volume 
 contel 's mr. wohlstetter said the group of big board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public 
 however he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support 
 among those mr. wohlstetter said he has been talking to are sanford <unk> of primerica corp. which is the parent of smith barney harris upham & co. gte corp. 's james johnson and itt corp. 's rand <unk> 
 none of these chief executives were available for comment 
 among the targets of the big board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments 
 for contel 's part the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms 
 it was just those kinds of <unk> that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate 
 kemper corp. 's kemper financial services unit said it cut off bear stearns morgan stanley oppenheimer and general electric co. 's kidder peabody & co. unit 
 all of the firms except kidder which is the <unk> program trader on wall street quickly announced <unk> from index arbitrage 
 kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading 
 chief executive officer michael carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of kidder 's own brokers he believes index arbitrage does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole 
 however pressure on kidder 's parent ge could change kidder 's policy 
 ge chairman john welch has been besieged with phone calls complaining about his unit 's program trading according to a person close to him 
 margaret thatcher 's <unk> response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual 
 that may be the last thing she needs 
 as the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and <unk> the government faces a <unk> job of rebuilding confidence in its policies 
 the prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer the <unk> john major need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again 
 mrs. thatcher has to come to terms with european economic integration beginning with the european monetary system which britain is committed to joining fully someday 
 finally the government has to convince a rattled financial community and voters it is proceeding <unk> toward its goals 
 it sounds like the work of a decade but the deadline is late N when mrs. thatcher is expected to call another national election 
 what 's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of <unk> with the political timetable 
 she could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit 
 though mrs. thatcher has pulled through other crises supporters wonder if her <unk> <unk> ways are the right formula today 
 there 's a rising fear that perhaps mrs. thatcher 's style of management has become a political liability says bill martin senior economist at london brokers <unk> & drew 
 the prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private <unk> of advisers including an economic <unk> who openly criticized former chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson confused the financial community 
 last week the strategy of playing the two experts off each other <unk> up mr. lawson quit in <unk> and sir alan walters the adviser announced his resignation within an hour 
 the confusion could be costly 
 currency traders <unk> mr. major wo n't defend the pound <unk> sent the british currency sharply lower friday against the dollar and west german mark 
 analysts expect further jitters this week 
 a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate currently N N 
 that could <unk> a weak economy into recession 
 economists have been anticipating a slump for months but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought 
 britain 's economy is developing rapidly toward <unk> says j. paul <unk> international economist with smith barney harris upham co. in paris 
 a mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early N economists say while the <unk> downturn now expected could stretch into N 
 recovery could be hampered if britain 's major trading partners in europe which are enjoying robust economic activity cool off as expected in late N and N 
 that would leave mrs. thatcher little room for maneuver 
 for the <unk> to win the next election voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year <unk> 
 though mrs. thatcher does n't need to call an election until june N she would prefer doing so in late N 
 if the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year 's time she will be very vulnerable says john <unk> a <unk> at the london school of economics 
 there 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the european community 
 it has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the european monetary system which links the major ec currencies 
 at a june ec summit mrs. thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full ems membership saying britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the ec <unk> capital movements 
 since then the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join 
 sir alan <unk> the monetary arrangement as <unk> in an article being published in an american economics journal 
 that produced little reaction from his boss reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a <unk> for avoiding full ems membership 
 despite the departure of mr. lawson and sir alan the <unk> over the ems could continue 
 sir <unk> <unk> deputy prime minister and a lawson ally on the ems has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership 
 of immediate concern is whether the thatcher government will continue mr. lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the west german <unk> and responding in kind when the frankfurt authorities move interest rates 
 mrs. thatcher does n't like taking orders from foreigners says tim <unk> economist with <unk> & national holding plc 
 as conservatives rally around mrs. thatcher during the crisis many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change 
 we wo n't have any more of this <unk> behavior says sir peter <unk> a <unk> <unk> member of parliament 
 the party is fed up with <unk> of good people 
 it 's an <unk> expectation 
 as long as a decade ago mrs. thatcher declared she did n't want debate in her cabinet she wanted strong government 
 over the weekend she said she did n't intend to change her style and denied she is <unk> 
 nonsense she told an <unk> yesterday on london weekend television

 wives may not benefit when men do chores 
 when <unk> take on more <unk> they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife 
 rand corp. researchers linda <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and N 
 the women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the <unk> share each did 
 not unexpectedly wives whether working or <unk> did by far the most about N N of the shopping <unk> and cooking and about two-thirds of <unk> <unk> <unk> child care and family paper work 
 only for <unk> and home maintenance did women do less than half 
 but the researchers found that while children 's household tasks eased the mother 's burden <unk> the husband 's helping hand appears to <unk> the children 's load almost on a <unk> basis and to reduce the wife 's responsibility only modestly 
 this pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples 
 in these families <unk> took on N N more chores than in couples with only <unk> school education 
 but the kids with highly educated parents did N N less <unk> than those in <unk> families 
 it is clear ms. <unk> says that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the <unk>

 nursing home patients apt to be private <unk> 
 far fewer elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed two recent studies declare 
 state governments place very low <unk> on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills 
 conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from <unk> to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before <unk> for medicaid assistance 
 but separate reports from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> institution and <unk> <unk> of the urban institute find that a surprisingly small proportion only about N N of residents start out as private <unk> but spend down to medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are <unk> 
 another one-third are already on medicaid when they enter the nursing homes a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated 
 but a <unk> high percentage over half are private <unk> throughout their stay even a fairly lengthy one 
 about one-third pay out of their own pockets while the rest are covered throughout by medicare private insurers or the veterans administration 
 both reports are based on several thousand patients <unk> in a N nationwide government survey 
 the <unk> and urban institute authors caution however that most nursing home stays are of <unk> short <unk> and reaching the medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays 
 moreover they note those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other <unk> 
 reagan era young hold liberal views 
 the reagan generation young men and women reaching political maturity during ronald reagan 's presidency are firmly liberal on race and <unk> according to <unk> the social science research center at the university of chicago 
 many political analysts have speculated that the reagan years would produce a <unk> conservative younger generation 
 <unk> 's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more <unk> and <unk> than other adults 
 but says chief investigator tom smith this does not translate into support for <unk> in general or into conservative positions on <unk> and civil rights issues 
 answers to a dozen questions in the N N N and N national surveys reveal that men and women in the N to N age <unk> are considerably more liberal on race and <unk> than were the N to N year <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> in the early 1970s and early 1980s 
 they were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the N through N surveys 
 for example N N of the N to N year <unk> in the four latest surveys favored an open housing law <unk> homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers 
 that compares with N N of the similar age group in the N through N surveys and N N in the N through N surveys 
 asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are <unk> better <unk> to politics than women N N of the reagan generation disagreed compared with under N N of younger men and women in the earlier years

 october was an <unk> month for the practitioners of glasnost the official soviet policy of allowing more <unk> from the nation 's media 
 for one of the <unk> of glasnost <unk> korotich editor of the <unk> weekly <unk> friday oct. N was a <unk> day that turned from tension to <unk> 
 he had been summoned to the central committee of the soviet communist party after he finished his lunch at the <unk> hotel an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic <unk> <unk> <unk> naked <unk> float on their <unk> toward a ceiling <unk> with <unk> all surrounded by <unk> laid on with a <unk> <unk> 's <unk> and supported by marble <unk> columns whose <unk> are <unk> <unk> of gold 
 why had mr. korotich been called 
 i told my driver he said that he was taking my <unk> to the central committee so they can <unk> <unk> <unk> his hand made vigorous <unk> gestures on his left palm 
 they feel the need from time to time to educate me 
 and indeed as he later reported that was the import of the meeting 
 anxious allies of president mikhail gorbachev are <unk> media leaders to take it easy to be careful not to do anything that could be used by mr. gorbachev 's opponents 
 the government is nervous 
 according to mr. korotich who was present mr. gorbachev 's publicized <unk> of the press on oct. N was more of a plea be careful boys use good judgment 
 we 're standing in gasoline so do n't smoke 
 u.s. and northern european diplomats confirm mr. korotich 's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger 
 in fact a very <unk> soviet official told an american official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated 
 the day after that conversation at the residence of the u.s. ambassador the <unk> editor of pravda victor <unk> was replaced by a college <unk> of mr. gorbachev 's 
 <unk> <unk> have more to fear from mr. gorbachev than the <unk> <unk> he gave to the press 
 at the end of the very week in which mr. korotich was called to the central committee <unk> was again <unk> its independence by printing a poll that showed that N N of the soviet population a <unk> believed that mr. gorbachev 's economic reforms perestroika would result in only <unk> change 
 a good measurement of the popularity of <unk> <unk> like <unk> is circulation 
 when mr. korotich took it over in N it sold N copies today it sells N million 
 pravda meanwhile has retained only N N of its N <unk> 
 glasnost has made <unk> of men like mr. korotich 
 prevented by the communist party from getting on its slate of <unk> for the new supreme soviet he stood as an independent candidate for congress from his native <unk> and won with N N of the vote 
 the same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the party he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the korotich party 
 but as <unk> as the changes that have already occurred are there is a <unk> to glasnost 
 censorship is n't a marxist <unk> 
 the <unk> were no civil <unk> 
 as late as the <unk> the russian government prevented any coverage of <unk> 
 it even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might <unk> the honor of the <unk> <unk> 's wives 
 so glasnost is not a value <unk> with steel <unk> into the fabric of russian society 
 it is an <unk> public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year <unk> of history 
 it is public relations of the highest <unk> that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty up to a point 
 what is that point 
 will <unk> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika 
 i 'd be destroying myself replies mr. korotich who then asks what would that accomplish 
 his answer reveals his <unk> it also draws the line that soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of western culture 
 it is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even <unk> leaders

 a state trial judge in illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a bank of new york co. unit irving trust co. over the interest rates on irving 's former one wall street account money-market deposit accounts 
 judge albert green in cook county circuit court in chicago also recognized the suit filed last may by robert and cynthia <unk> as a class action covering thousands of irving customers 
 the plaintiffs accused irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing <unk> 
 irving maintained and still does that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers 
 under the proposed settlement customers with valid claims to be submitted by dec. N will receive valuable bank services such as credit cards with reduced finance charges for two years 
 larry <unk> attorney for the plaintiffs valued the settlement at between $ N million and $ N million 
 a bank of new york spokesman in manhattan owen brady said that 's the maximum outside figure 
 federal reserve critics used to complain of stop and go monetary policies 
 they claimed that the fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a <unk> halt 
 but under alan greenspan that has changed 
 a <unk> cautious man the fed chairman is forever <unk> yellow 
 indeed his caution has become legendary within the government 
 he <unk> <unk> over economic statistics <unk> them in dozens of ways probing for hours in search of potential problems 
 after <unk> <unk> <unk> of information he often concludes that more data are needed and when he finally decides to act his movements sometimes seem <unk> small 
 such caution was evident after the recent friday-the-13th stock market plunge 
 some bush administration officials urged mr. greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets 
 but he refused claiming that he wanted to see what happened monday morning before making any public statement 
 mr. greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a <unk> within the fed 's ranks 
 a senior fed official spoke on saturday after the market <unk> to both the washington post and the new york times saying the fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed 
 the statement angered chairman greenspan but it was greeted with applause by the bush administration and the financial markets 
 and while the <unk> fed member has n't gone public some fed governors most notably vice chairman manuel johnson are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent 
 ironically the <unk> official 's comments have earned some <unk> for mr. greenspan who is mistakenly seen as the source 
 at a hearing last week democratic sen. chris dodd of connecticut told treasury secretary nicholas brady that chairman greenspan 's announcement over the oct. N weekend was a very important statement 
 mr. brady <unk> replied that he was n't sure whether mr. greenspan made a statement himself or whether that was a newspaper report 
 the fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the monday morning after the market 's plunge when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets 
 a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system 
 and by the end of that week the key federal funds interest rate which is largely controlled by the fed had settled at N N barely changed from the level of just under N N that prevailed the previous week 
 bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that mr. greenspan is cautious to a fault 
 signs of growing weakness in the economy <unk> with indications that inflation is staying well under control have caused them to wonder why the fed chairman is so <unk> in reducing rates 
 those concerns are n't expressed in public 
 in fact the administration and the fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to <unk> any impression that they are at odds <unk> stories about an <unk> split added to the stock market 's jitters 
 still the split is there 
 the administration 's concerns are <unk> 
 the economy is showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers 
 exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years seem to have stalled 
 factory <unk> and production fell in september and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch 
 but mr. greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy partly because he faces a <unk> of presidents of regional fed banks who oppose credit easing 
 in addition the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road 
 inflation may be stable at the moment running at about N N 
 but if the fed <unk> too soon mr. greenspan fears prices may begin to accelerate again next year 
 moreover if the fed holds tight it may be able gradually to reduce inflation moving toward the <unk> goal that the fed chairman embraced in testimony to congress last week 
 so far mr. greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well 
 his hand on the monetary <unk> seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of <unk> growth without a recession 
 we 've gotten through two stock market crashes and we 've gone through an election without any major problems says david <unk> an economist of kemper financial services 
 i think you have to give greenspan a good rating 
 but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes 
 the fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the <unk> for a new recession perhaps starting early next year 
 if that happens chairman greenspan could well become an open target 
 already congress is <unk> with legislation to curb the fed 's independence 
 if the economy turns down such proposals could gain strong momentum

 in an age of <unk> the federal judiciary is one of the last <unk> of the <unk> 
 a judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases from <unk> to securities fraud without missing a beat 
 but even on the federal bench <unk> is creeping in and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court 
 the court of appeals for the federal circuit was created in N to serve among other things as the court of last resort for most patent disputes 
 previously patent cases moved through the court system to one of the N circuit appeals courts 
 there judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field <unk> with some of the most technical and complex disputes <unk> 
 a new specialty court was sought by patent experts who believed that the <unk> had <unk> too many important multimillion-dollar cases 
 some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field 
 but the reagan administration thought otherwise and so may the bush administration 
 since N the president has filled four <unk> in the federal circuit court with <unk> lawyers 
 now only three of the N judges <unk> <unk> chief judge howard t. markey N and <unk> rich N have <unk> backgrounds 
 the latter two and judge daniel m. <unk> N are approaching senior status or retirement 
 three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years so patent lawyers and <unk> industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court 
 several organizations including the industrial <unk> association and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association have asked the white house and justice department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds 
 the associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training 
 some of the associations have recommended dr. alan d. <unk> N a former patent agent with a <unk> in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with <unk> <unk> corp. in philadelphia 
 dr. <unk> says the justice department interviewed him last july 
 their effort has received a <unk> response from the justice department 
 we do not feel that seats are reserved for patent lawyers says justice spokesman david runkel who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named 
 but we will take it into consideration 
 the justice department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court judge h. robert mayer a former civil <unk> who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the federal circuit two years ago 
 i believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law judge mayer says adding that it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers who argue before the court to make us understand complex patent litigation 
 yet some lawyers point to eli lilly & co. vs. <unk> inc. the patent infringement case the supreme court this month agreed to review as an example of poor legal <unk> by judges who lack patent litigation experience 
 judge mayer was not on the <unk> panel 
 in the lilly case the appeals court broadly <unk> a federal statute to grant <unk> a medical device manufacturer an exemption to <unk> a patent under certain circumstances 
 if the supreme court holds in <unk> 's favor the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices color and food <unk> and all other <unk> products that required food & drug administration approval 
 <unk> <unk> a lawyer and director of government relations for the industrial <unk> association contends that a judge <unk> in patent law and the concerns of <unk> industries would have ruled otherwise 
 and judge <unk> a former patent lawyer wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a <unk> of the case by the full court the panel 's judicial legislation has affected an important <unk> industry without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest 
 says ms. <unk> the judgment confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome

 kidder peabody & co. is trying to struggle back 
 only a few months ago the <unk> securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a <unk> racked by internal <unk> and <unk> 
 its relationship with parent general electric co. had been <unk> since a big kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago 
 chief executives and presidents had come and gone 
 now the firm says it 's at a turning point 
 by the end of this year <unk> chairman <unk> cathcart the former chairman of illinois tool works who was <unk> as a <unk> man when ge brought him in to clean up kidder in N <unk> to his lake forest ill. home possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns 
 i 've done what i came to do at kidder he says 
 and that means <unk> michael carpenter president and chief executive since january will for the first time take complete control of kidder and try to make good on some <unk> plans 
 mr. carpenter says he will return kidder to <unk> as a great investment bank 
 wall street is <unk> skeptical 
 through the first nine months of the year kidder ranks a distant <unk> among underwriters of u.s. stocks and bonds with a N N market share up slightly from N N in the year-earlier period according to securities data co 
 it 's quite a fall from the early 1980s when kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse 
 gary s. <unk> president of the <unk> group an executive search firm said i 'd like to see kidder succeed 
 but they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one 
 in N kidder <unk> out a $ N million profit mainly because of severe cost cutting 
 its <unk> brokerage operation reported an estimated $ N million loss last year although kidder expects it to turn a profit this year 
 in fact kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading in that controversial business only morgan stanley & co. rivals kidder 
 but even that niche is under attack as several wall street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors 
 mr. carpenter a former <unk> executive who has a love for task forces says he has done a complete <unk> of kidder in recent months 
 there have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations 
 more than N new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since january 
 the firm 's brokerage force has been trimmed and its <unk> staff increased to a record N people 
 mr. carpenter says that when he assumes full control kidder will finally tap the resources of ge 
 one of ge 's goals when it bought N N of kidder in N was to take advantage of <unk> between kidder and general electric capital corp. ge 's <unk> unit which has $ N billion in assets 
 the leveraged buy-out group of ge capital now reports to mr. carpenter 
 so far instead of <unk> up ge capital staffers and kidder investment bankers have <unk> 
 yet says mr. carpenter we 've really started to exploit the <unk> between ge capital and kidder peabody 
 the units have worked on N investment banking deals this year he says though not all of them have <unk> out 
 we 've had a good relationship with ge which is the first time you could say that <unk> let me withdraw that 
 it 's been a steadily improving relationship says mr. carpenter 
 still without many actual deals to show off kidder is left to stress that it finally has a team in place and that everyone works harder 
 a month ago the firm started serving dinner at about N each night about N to N of the N people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late 
 we are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past says scott c. <unk> kidder 's head of investment banking since june 
 everywhere kidder <unk> the always working theme 
 a new in-house magazine kidder world which will focus on the firm 's <unk> strategy says mr. carpenter <unk> that on <unk> mr. <unk> often gets <unk> ideas while flying his <unk> <unk> <unk> on the way to <unk> 
 the firm 's new head of mergers and acquisitions under mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> talks of the opportunity to rebuild a franchise at kidder 
 the kidder name is one of only six or seven that every ceo recognizes as a viable alternative when considering a merger deal he says 
 now according to a kidder world story about mr. <unk> all the firm has to do is position ourselves more in the deal flow 
 with investment banking as kidder 's lead business where do kidder 's <unk> brokerage network and its N brokers fit in 
 mr. carpenter this month sold off kidder 's eight brokerage offices in florida and puerto rico to merrill lynch & co. <unk> speculation that kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely 
 mr. carpenter denies the speculation 
 to answer the brokerage question kidder in typical fashion completed a <unk> study 
 the result kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies much closer to the <unk> of goldman sachs & co. than a <unk> firm like merrill lynch or shearson lehman hutton inc 
 mr. carpenter notes that these types of investors also are sophisticated enough not to complain about kidder 's aggressive use of program trading 
 as part of the upscale push kidder is putting brokers through a <unk> training course turning them into investment <unk> with knowledge of corporate finance 
 they will get new and improved tools to sell particularly to the affluent investor says brokerage chief charles v. <unk> 
 <unk> the brokers will then be able to <unk> leads on corporate finance opportunities to kidder 's investment bankers possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps 
 however skeptics caution that this kind of <unk> between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper but does n't always happen 
 kidder competitors are n't <unk> hostile to the firm as many are to a tough competitor like drexel burnham lambert inc. that does n't have kidder 's long history 
 however competitors say that kidder 's hiring binge involving <unk> staffers some with <unk> contract guarantees could <unk> unless there are results 
 the <unk> mr. cathcart says he has no worries about kidder 's future 
 mr. cathcart who will return to the <unk> <unk> co. board of directors in addition to his personal ventures is credited with bringing some basic <unk> and planning discipline to traditionally <unk> kidder 
 he also improved the firm 's compliance procedures for trading 
 mr. cathcart says he has had a lot of fun at kidder adding the crack about his being a <unk> man never bothered him 
 it was an absolutely <unk> line and one i used many times he says 
 smiling broadly when he talks about mr. carpenter mr. cathcart says the new kidder chief is going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business 
 in coming years mr. cathcart says kidder is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 or as mr. carpenter again drawing on his <unk> background puts it we 're ready to implement at this point

 in what could prove a major addition to the philippines ' <unk> portfolio a taiwanese company signed a $ N million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex 
 taiwan 's <unk> far east corp. a petrochemical company <unk> the agreement with an unidentified japanese contractor to build a <unk> <unk> according to <unk> lee who heads the philippine company set up to build and operate the complex 
 mr. lee president of luzon petrochemical corp. said the contract was signed wednesday in tokyo with <unk> far east officials 
 contract details however have n't been made public 
 the complex is to be located in <unk> about N miles south of manila 
 <unk> far east will hold a N N stake in luzon petrochemical according to papers signed with the philippine government 's board of investments 
 the proposed petrochemical plant would use <unk> to manufacture the petrochemicals <unk> and <unk> and their <unk> <unk> <unk> and polyethylene 
 these are the raw materials used in making plastics 
 the contract signing represented a major step in the <unk> petrochemical project 
 at an estimated $ N million the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the philippines since president <unk> aquino took office in february N 
 it also is considered critical to the country 's efforts to both attract other investment from taiwan and raise heavy industry <unk> 
 the project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade 
 however workers ca n't break ground until legal <unk> to block the complex are resolved moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment 
 as previously reported a member of the philippines ' house of representatives has sued to stop the plant 
 the legislator <unk> garcia had actively backed the plant but at the original site in his constituency northwest of manila 
 the country 's supreme court dismissed the suit but mr. garcia late last month filed for a <unk> 
 in addition president aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff N N tax on <unk> the principal raw material to be used in the <unk> 
 however at a news conference thursday mrs. aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to <unk> the feelings of residents at the original site adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in <unk> province 
 we have tried our best to tell the people in <unk> that maybe this time it will not go to them but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province mrs. aquino told <unk> foreign <unk> 
 the project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project china general plastics corp. backed out

 however mr. lee said that <unk> far east is confident other investors will take up the slack 
 he said <unk> far east has applied to both the asian development bank and the world bank 's international finance corp. for financing that could include equity stakes

 president bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and <unk> the <unk> out of government programs 
 he wants it now 
 not so fast says rep. <unk> edwards of oklahoma a fellow republican 
 i consider it one of the <unk> ideas of the 20th century he says 
 it 's the line-item veto a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by congress without <unk> the entire bill 
 whatever one thinks of the idea it 's far more than the budgetary <unk> it may seem at first <unk> 
 rather it 's a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with democrats and republicans alike in congress fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business 
 president bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president 
 now the white house is declaring that he might not rely on congress which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority to pass the line-item veto law he seeks 
 white house spokesmen last week said mr. bush is considering simply declaring that the constitution gives him the power exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right 
 although that may sound like an <unk> maneuver of little interest outside washington it would set off a political earthquake 
 the <unk> are enormous says rep. don edwards a california democrat who is a senior member of the house judiciary committee 
 it 's a real face-to-face arm <unk> challenge to congress 
 white house aides know it 's a step that ca n't be taken <unk> and for that reason the president may back down from launching a test case this year 
 some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a <unk> bill looming mr. bush already has enough pending <unk> with congress 
 they prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year 
 still mr. bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto 
 the issue arose last week when vice president dan quayle told an audience in chicago that mr. bush was looking for a test case 
 white house press secretary marlin fitzwater confirmed that mr. bush was interested in the idea but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it 
 mr. bush former president reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process 
 they maintain that a president needs the ability to <unk> remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills 
 those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their <unk> because they often are needed to keep the government operating 
 conservatives note that N governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets 
 more <unk> some conservative legal <unk> have begun arguing that mr. bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the constitution 
 they base their argument on a clause buried in article i section N of the constitution that states every order resolution or vote to which the <unk> of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of <unk> shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or <unk> by him 
 this clause they argue is designed to go beyond an earlier clause <unk> that the president can veto a bill and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills 
 senate minority leader robert dole r. kan. for one <unk> this argument and earlier this year publicly urged mr. bush to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional 
 there 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the supreme court to be ultimately resolved 
 it 's a major issue and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level says stephen <unk> a new york attorney whose <unk> have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto 
 rep. edwards the california democrat is one who <unk> that he would immediately challenge mr. bush in the courts arguing a line-item veto would expand a president 's powers far beyond anything the <unk> of the constitution had in mind 
 it puts this president in the legislative business he declares 
 that 's not what our <unk> had in mind 
 in addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in congress rep. edwards argues a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to <unk> lawmakers 
 he notes that as a <unk> from the san francisco area he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the bay area rapid transit system 
 if a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial <unk> initiative rep. edwards says the president could call and declare that he would <unk> kill the bart funds unless the congressman <unk> up on the <unk> issue 
 proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more <unk> than that 
 but there may be another problem with the device despite all the political <unk> it would cause it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit 
 big chunks of the government budget like the <unk> programs of social security and medicare would n't be affected 
 governors have found that they have to use the device <unk> to maintain political <unk> 
 and it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves 
 still proponents contend that the veto would have what mr. <unk> calls an important <unk> effect on all manner of appropriations bills 
 lawmakers they say would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later 
 whatever the outcome of a test case president bush would have to move cautiously <unk> the very attempt would <unk> not just democrats but republicans says louis fisher a scholar at the congressional research service who specializes in <unk> relations 
 republicans have as much interest as democrats in the way the system works he notes 
 indeed although a majority of republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto some ranging from liberal oregon sen. mark <unk> to conservative rep. edwards are opposed 
 rep. edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person 
 conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now he notes may regret it later sometime you 're going to have a democratic president again who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives 
 every order resolution or vote to which the <unk> of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of <unk> shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or being <unk> by him shall be <unk> by two-thirds of the senate and house of representatives according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill 
 this has n't been kellogg co. 's year 
 the <unk> craze has cost the world 's largest cereal maker market share 
 the company 's president quit suddenly 
 and now kellogg is indefinitely <unk> work on what was to be a $ N billion cereal plant 
 the company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions 
 but the memphis tenn. facility was n't to begin turning out product until N so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well 
 kellogg which has n't been as successful in <unk> on the public 's <unk> desire for oat bran as rival general mills inc. has been losing share in the $ N billion <unk> cereal market 
 kellogg 's current share is believed to be slightly under N N while general mills ' share is about N N 
 led by its <unk> <unk> line general mills has gained an estimated N N share so far this year mostly at the expense of kellogg 
 each share point is worth about $ N million in sales 
 analysts say much of kellogg 's erosion has been in such core brands as corn <unk> rice <unk> and <unk> <unk> which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume 
 kellogg is so anxious to turn around corn <unk> sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as N cents trade sources say 
 <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> have <unk> away sales normally going to kellogg 's <unk> lines simply because they are made of <unk> says merrill lynch food analyst william <unk> 
 they are not a happy group of people at battle creek right now

 another analyst john c. maxwell jr. of wheat first securities in richmond va. recently went to a sell recommendation on kellogg stock which closed friday at $ N down N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 i do n't think kellogg can get back to N N this year he said 
 kellogg 's main problem is life style 
 people are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that 's healthy for you <unk> bran 
 mr. maxwell said he would n't be surprised if over the next two years or so general mills ' share increased to N N or more 
 in announcing the plant delay kellogg chairman william e. <unk> said cereal volume growth in the u.s. has not met our expectations for N 
 he said construction would n't resume until market conditions warrant it 
 kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities 
 the company has five other u.s. plants including a modern facility at its battle creek headquarters known as building N which is to add <unk> and <unk> capacity next year 
 general mills meanwhile finds itself <unk> from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity 
 a large plant in <unk> ga. is to come on line next year 
 a kellogg officer who asked not to be named said the memphis project was pulled in for a <unk> of costs an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction 
 initial cost estimates for the plant which was to have been built in <unk> ranged from $ N billion to $ N billion 
 a company spokesman said it was possible but highly unlikely that the plant might never be built 
 as we regain our leadership level where we have been and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity we will look at <unk> our involvement with our plan he said 
 the new facility was to have been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant and kellogg 's largest construction project 
 the company had retained the fluor daniel unit of fluor corp. as general contractor

 last friday 's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company 's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic 
 until recently kellogg had been telling its sales force and wall street that by N it intended to achieve a N N share of market measured in dollar volume 
 although he called current market conditions highly competitive mr. <unk> kellogg 's chairman and chief executive officer forecast an earnings increase for the full year 
 last year the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 as expected kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings

 the <unk> of <unk> companies from the singapore exchange may not be a smooth process analysts say 
 though the split has long been expected the exchanges are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways 
 the finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a <unk> in relations between the neighboring countries 
 rather the two closely linked exchanges have been <unk> apart for some years with a nearly <unk> <unk> on new dual listings separate and different listing requirements <unk> trading and settlement guidelines and <unk> <unk> aims

 as competition <unk> up in spain 's crowded bank market banco exterior de <unk> is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities 
 under the direction of its new chairman francisco luzon spain 's seventh largest bank is <unk> a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization 
 the state-owned industrial holding company <unk> <unk> de <unk> and the bank of spain jointly hold a N N stake in banco exterior 
 the government directly owns N N and <unk> a financial services company holds N N 
 the rest is listed on spanish stock exchanges 
 some analysts are concerned however that banco exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional <unk> activities 
 catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services they argue will be difficult particularly if market conditions turn sour 
 if that proves true analysts say banco exterior could be a prime partner or even a takeover target for either a spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after N when the european community plans to <unk> financial barriers 
 with N branches in spain and N banking subsidiaries five branches and N representative offices abroad the banco exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor 
 mr. luzon and his team however say they are n't interested in a merger 
 instead they are working to transform banco exterior into an efficient bank by the end of N 
 i want this to be a model of the way a <unk> company should be run mr. luzon says 
 banco exterior was created in N to provide subsidized credits for spanish exports 
 the market for export financing was <unk> in the mid-1980s however forcing the bank to face competition 
 at the same time many of spain 's traditional export markets in latin america and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth 
 as a result the volume of banco exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from N billion <unk> $ N billion as of dec. N N to its current N billion pesetas 
 the other two main <unk> of banco exterior 's traditional business wholesale banking and foreign currency trading also began to <unk> under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs 
 the bank was <unk> in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government analysts say 
 until mr. luzon took the helm last november banco exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes 
 but mr. luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy cut costs increase capital and build up new areas of business 
 we 've got a lot to do he acknowledged 
 we 've got to move quickly 
 in mr. luzon 's first year the bank eliminated N jobs 
 now it says it 'll trim another N jobs over the next three to four years 
 the bank employs N people in spain and N abroad 
 to strengthen its capital base banco exterior this year issued $ N million in subordinated debt launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors 
 the bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches 
 last year 's drop in export credit was partially offset by a N N surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies 
 though spain has an excess of banks analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in europe which will aid banco exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead 
 expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets 
 the bank says it 's interested in purchasing banks in <unk> portugal and puerto rico 
 but the bank 's retail activities in latin america are likely to be cut back 
 banco exterior was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four spanish stock exchanges <unk> sweeping changes in july 
 the late start may be a <unk> for the bank as spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition 
 but mr. luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from banco <unk> <unk> where he was formerly director general will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of N 
 the bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from london frankfurt zurich and paris into the spanish stock exchanges 
 general motors corp. 's general counsel hopes to cut the number of outside law firms the auto maker uses from about N to N within two years 
 harry j. pearce named general counsel in may N says the reduction is a cost-cutting measure and an effort to let the no. N auto maker 's <unk> in-house legal department take on matters it is better equipped and trained to handle 
 gm trimmed about N firms from its approved local counsel list mr. pearce says 
 the move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in-house instead of <unk> it out to law firms 
 mr. pearce set up gm 's first in-house litigation group in may with four lawyers all former assistant u.s. attorneys with extensive trial experience 
 he intends to add to the litigation staff 
 among the types of cases the in-house <unk> handle are disputes involving companies doing business with gm and <unk> actions including one in which a driver is suing gm for damages resulting from an accident 
 mr. pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with gm 's technical staffs to help prevent future litigation 
 gm lawyers have been working with technicians to develop more uniform <unk> procedures the way a vehicle is <unk> has a lot to do with its <unk> 
 the lawyers also monitor suits to identify specific automobile parts that cause the biggest legal problems 
 mr. pearce says law firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with gm will be those providing the <unk> service at the best cost <unk> similar <unk> from gm 's auto operations to suppliers 
 this does n't necessarily mean larger firms have an advantage mr. pearce said gm works with a number of smaller firms it <unk> highly 
 mr. pearce has shaken up gm 's legal staff by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions including a <unk> group that has made films on safety and drunk driving 
 federal prosecutors are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials 
 that 's a finding of a new study of the justice department by researchers at <unk> university 
 david burnham one of the authors says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains 
 in N N N of federal prosecutions concluded at trial in N only N N did 
 the study covered N major u.s. attorneys ' offices including those in manhattan and brooklyn n.y. and new jersey from N to N 
 the justice department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain 
 our felony <unk> have been consistent for N years with about N N of all prosecutions going to trial a department spokeswoman said 
 the <unk> is somewhat <unk> in that the <unk> researchers said they based their conclusions on government statistics 
 one possible explanation for this decline in taking cases to trial says mr. burnham is that the number of defendants being charged with crimes by all u.s. attorneys has substantially increased 
 in N the study says prosecutors surveyed filed charges against N defendants for each N people aged N years and older 
 in N prosecutors filed against N defendants for every N adults 
 another finding from the study prosecutors set significantly different priorities 
 the manhattan u.s. attorney 's office stressed criminal cases from N to N averaging N for every N adults 
 but the new jersey u.s. attorney averaged N 
 on the civil side the manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only N cases for every N adults during the same period the san francisco u.s. attorney averaged N 
 the study is to provide reporters academic experts and others raw data on which to base further inquiries

 the prosecutor quoted statements from the <unk> in which they said they were in this country at the invitation of president reagan and that they were enjoying the <unk> of the u.s. 
 lawyers for mrs. marcos say that because she was taken to the u.s. against her wishes the federal court lacks jurisdiction in the case 
 the federal court of appeals in manhattan ruled that the dismissal of a N indictment against former bank of <unk> owner george <unk> should be <unk> 
 the indictment which was <unk> and apparently forgotten by investigators until N charges mr. <unk> and three others with tax fraud and other violations 
 he made numerous trips to the u.s. in the early 1980s but was n't arrested until N when he showed up as a guest of <unk> president george bush at a government function 
 a federal judge in manhattan threw out the indictment finding that the seven-year delay violated the defendant 's constitutional right to a <unk> trial 
 the appeals court however said the judge did n't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial 
 mr. <unk> is fighting <unk> proceedings that would return him to greece where he is charged with <unk> more than $ N million from the bank of <unk>

 costa rica reached an agreement with its creditor banks that is expected to cut that government 's $ N billion in bank debt by as much as N N 
 the agreement was announced by costa rican president <unk> arias friday as president bush and other leaders from the western <unk> gathered in the central american nation for a celebration of democracy 
 costa rica had been negotiating with the u.s. and other banks for three years but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting 
 the government had fallen $ N million behind in interest payments 
 treasury secretary nicholas brady called the agreement an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy noting that it will when implemented provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by costa rica 
 under the plan costa rica will buy back roughly N N of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price according to officials involved in the agreement 
 the remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new costa rican bonds with a N N N interest rate 
 the international monetary fund and the world bank are expected to provide approximately $ N million to help support the deal and additional funds are expected from japan 
 treasury officials say the costa rican agreement demonstrates that the brady debt plan can benefit small <unk> countries as well as big <unk> such as mexico 
 the treasury said it plans to sell $ N billion of <unk> <unk> bills today raising all new cash 
 the bills will be dated oct. N and will mature dec. N 
 no <unk> tenders will be accepted 
 tenders available in minimum denominations of $ N million must be received by noon est today at federal reserve banks or branches 
 the treasury also announced details of this week 's unusual bill auction which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at midnight tomorrow 
 the 13-week and <unk> bills will be issued tomorrow rather than thursday nov. N as originally planned 
 the three-month bills will still mature feb. N N and the six-month bills on may N N 
 the treasury also said <unk> tenders will be considered timely if <unk> no later than sunday oct. N and received no later than tomorrow 
 the treasury said it wo n't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing nov. N held in the treasury 's <unk> system 
 the department will make payment for bills maturing on nov. N to all investors who have requested reinvestment of their bills on that date as well as to all account holders who have previously requested payment 
 american pioneer inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its american pioneer life insurance co. subsidiary to <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's <unk> insurance cos. for $ N million 
 american pioneer parent of american pioneer savings bank said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company 
 recently the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares 
 the company said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements 
 the transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies including the insurance departments of the states of florida and indiana the company said 
 in the second quarter american pioneer reported a loss of $ N million compared with net income of $ N million a year earlier 
 the banking operation had a loss of $ N million in the second quarter largely because of problem real-estate loans while the insurance operations earned $ N 
 october employment data also could turn out to be the most confusing 
 on the surface the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from september 's N N 
 but the actual head count of <unk> employment payroll jobs is likely to be <unk> by the impact of hurricane hugo strikes and <unk> seasonal adjustments economists said 
 the consensus view calls for an overall job gain of N compared with september 's N increase 
 but the important <unk> segment which last month plunged by N positions and raised recession fears is most likely to be <unk> by the month 's unusual events 
 several other reports come before friday 's jobs data including the september leading indicators index new-home sales and october agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow the october purchasing managers ' index and september construction spending and manufacturers ' orders on wednesday and october <unk> sales on thursday 
 friday brings the final count on october auto sales 
 the employment report is going to be difficult to interpret said michael <unk> economist with <unk> international a unit of mcgraw-hill inc. new york 
 mr. <unk> added that next month 's data is n't likely to be much better because it will be distorted by san francisco 's earthquake 
 what 's more he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year are n't <unk> at the same time as in the past because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the <unk> of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data 
 wednesday 's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below N N as it has for the past couple of months 
 a reading of less than N N indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above N N indicates an economy that 's expanding 
 samuel d. <unk> chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities inc. chicago said that the purchasers ' report is valuable because it often presents the first <unk> of economic data for the month 
 but he added some people use the purchasers ' index as a leading indicator some use it as a <unk> indicator 
 but the thing it 's supposed to measure manufacturing strength it missed altogether last month 
 david wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc. boston said that the purchasers ' index does miss occasionally adding when it misses one month it tends to miss the next month too 
 the consensus view on september leading indicators calls for a gain of N N the same as in august 
 economists said greatly increased consumer optimism a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index 
 all <unk> components such as <unk> orders and building permits are thought to have been weaker 
 data resources ' mr. wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than <unk> on october <unk> sales 
 usually october is n't a very interesting month for retail figures because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for december to buy christmas presents he said 
 but mr. wyss said he will watch the numbers to get an <unk> of whether consumers ' general buying habits may slack off as much as their <unk> apparently has 
 he noted that higher gasoline prices will help <unk> the october totals 
 seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on september new-home sales which are believed to have fallen sharply from august 's N units 
 construction spending is believed to have slipped about N N from august levels although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage 
 factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall machine tool makers say but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry 
 september orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums but remained N N below year-earlier levels according to figures from <unk> the association for manufacturing technology 
 domestic machine tool plants received $ N million of orders last month up N N from august 's $ N million but still below the $ N million of september N <unk> said 
 machine tools are complex machines ranging from <unk> to <unk> <unk> that are used to shape most metal parts 
 overall demand still is very respectable says christopher c. <unk> group vice president at cincinnati <unk> inc. the nation 's largest machine tool producer 
 the outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term 
 september orders for all u.s. producers in fact were slightly above the monthly average for N a good year for the industry 
 aerospace orders are very good mr. <unk> says 
 and export business is still good 
 while some automotive programs have been delayed they have n't been canceled 
 september was one of the biggest order months in our history says james r. roberts vice president world-wide sales and marketing for <unk> & lewis inc. <unk> du <unk> <unk> 
 at a recent meeting of manufacturing executives everybody i talked with was very positive he says 
 most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in N than in N 
 but sales of north <unk> <unk> cars are running at an annual rate of only six million down from N million a year earlier 
 and truck sales also are off more than N N 
 auto makers who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales do n't pick up machine tool builders say 
 machine tool executives are hopeful however that recent developments in eastern europe will expand markets for <unk> machine tools in that region 
 there is demand for <unk> machine tools in the soviet union and in other eastern european countries as those nations <unk> to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods 
 however there 's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the defense department over whether sophisticated u.s. machine tools would increase the soviet union 's military might 
 the commerce department says go and the defense department says stop complains one machine tool producer 
 if that controversy continues u.s. machine tool makers say west german and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in eastern europe 
 september orders for <unk> centers <unk> <unk> machines <unk> boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled $ N million down N N from $ N million a year earlier but a N N increase from august 's $ N million <unk> said 
 orders last month for <unk> <unk> and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $ N million a N N rise from $ N million a year earlier and a N N gain from $ N million in august 
 today 's <unk> are large and costly machines and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that does n't necessarily indicate a trend 
 machine tool shipments last month were $ N million a N N rise from a year earlier and a N N increase from august 
 shipments have run well ahead of N all year as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs 
 u.s. producers had a $ N billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of september 
 that was up N N from a year earlier even though orders for the first nine months of N were down N N from the comparable N period

 in <unk> stock market circles the <unk> is <unk> 
 at least N companies are coming to the capital market to raise $ N billion an amount never thought possible in india 
 when they talk mega-issues they 're truly talking <unk> says s.a. dave chairman of the securities and exchange board of india 
 the capital market is booming 
 but the mega-issues are raising <unk> about the rapidly <unk> indian capital market 
 one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without <unk> stock trading 
 moreover in the relatively <unk> indian stock markets investors frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue 
 a prospectus in india does n't always tell a potential investor much 
 some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms 
 in addition once money is raised investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent 
 some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues in such an <unk> environment could lead to a <unk> 
 the rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the <unk> says <unk> patel a former chairman of the giant <unk> mutual fund the unit trust of india 
 they 're going to have <unk> 
 the indian stock markets have been on a five-year high with <unk> and <unk> since prime minister <unk> gandhi started <unk> industry 
 but the last stock market boom in N seems small compared with the current rush to market 
 the $ N billion that some N companies are looking to raise in the year ending march N compares with only $ N billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year 
 in fiscal N before mr. gandhi came to power only $ N million was raised 
 this year 's biggest issue $ N million of convertible debentures by engineering company larsen & toubro ltd. is the largest in indian history 
 and it is n't the only giant issue together the top four issues will raise $ N billion 
 convertible debentures bonds that can later be converted into equity shares are the most popular instrument this year though many companies are also selling <unk> bonds or equity shares 
 these mega-issues are being propelled by two factors economic and political 
 in the past the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills petrochemical plants car factories and other industrial concerns to <unk> resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make 
 as a result industry operated out of small expensive highly inefficient industrial units 
 when mr. gandhi came to power he <unk> in new rules for business 
 he said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside india and benefit from economies of scale 
 if the output was too great for the domestic market he said companies should export 
 india 's <unk> businessmen had to be persuaded but they have started to think big 
 some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first <unk> of mr. gandhi 's policy and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past 
 the industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market which is a far cheaper source of funds than <unk> banks where interest rates for prime borrowers are around N N 
 the second factor spurring mega-issues is political 
 mr. gandhi has called general elections for november and many businessmen fear that he and his congress i party will lose 
 some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than mr. gandhi 's and possibly more restrictive 
 the <unk> <unk> rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections 
 no one admits to anything but india 's <unk> have a history of making <unk> campaign donations 
 so far the mega-issues are a hit with investors 
 earlier this year <unk> iron & steel co. 's offer of $ N million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed 
 <unk> <unk> ltd. a marine construction company had similar success with a slightly smaller issue 
 larsen & toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed 
 still to come are big issues by <unk> <unk> <unk> ltd. a petrochemical and <unk> company and <unk> <unk> corp india a semiconductor maker 
 while many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues prices on india 's N stock exchanges are holding up so far 
 i do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market says mr. patel only a sagging tendency 
 says <unk> <unk> chairman of the unit trust of india the markets are headed for growth <unk> of and <unk> before 
 but with growth come growing <unk> and never has this been <unk> on the indian capital market than now 
 in the past the government controlled the markets indirectly through its tight grip on industry itself 
 various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans 
 the government has been content with this far-reaching <unk> form of control exercised on a <unk> basis with no clear rules or guidelines 
 but now with large amounts being raised from investors the government 's <unk> on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect 
 the securities and exchange board of india was set up earlier this year along the lines of the u.s. securities and exchange commission but new <unk> has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational 
 mr. dave its head acts <unk> and patient but he makes no <unk> about the need to get to work 
 <unk> or <unk> we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved he says 
 disclosures are very poor in india 
 he says the big questions do you really need this much money to put up these investments have you told investors what is happening in your sector what about your track record are n't asked of companies coming to market 
 instead he says most investors have to rely on the <unk> indian press 
 an example is the biggest offering of them all larsen & toubro 's $ N million bond issue 
 the engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant reliance textile group 
 although larsen & toubro had n't raised money from the public in N years its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market 
 reliance <unk> a $ N million petrochemical company in N that was at the time the largest public issue in indian history 
 the media has raised questions about larsen & toubro 's issue pointing out that it exceeds the company 's annual sales and its market capitalization 
 even <unk> is the case of <unk> <unk> a semiconductor company with N sales of $ N million that 's raising $ N million to build an iron plant 
 once the money is raised it is n't always certain how it is used 
 larsen & toubro for example says it 's raising $ N million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs 
 unlike other companies it has n't <unk> specific projects for the funds 
 and even when specific projects are described in <unk> the money often is used elsewhere according to analysts 
 someone must monitor where the funds are deployed says mr. dave 
 mr. patel agrees there is no proper monitoring and <unk> of the use of these funds 
 they 're trying to plug the various <unk> but they 're totally <unk> for this 
 because of the large amounts of money being raised the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used some analysts fear that there could be a few <unk> which could hurt market confidence far more than the small <unk> that followed the boom of N 
 the government insists that such a possibility is low 
 it says that despite loose regulation of the market itself its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes

 lion nathan ltd. a new zealand brewing and retail concern said friday that bond corp holdings ltd. is committed to a transaction <unk> lion nathan would acquire N N of bond 's australian brewing assets

 general motors corp. and ford motor co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of jaguar plc as gm got early clearance from the federal trade commission to boost its stake in the british luxury car maker 
 gm confirmed friday that it received permission late thursday from u.s. antitrust regulators to increase its jaguar holdings past the $ N million level 
 ford got a similar <unk> earlier in october and on friday jaguar announced that the no. N u.s. auto maker had raised its stake to N N or N million shares from N N earlier in the week 
 a spokesman for gm the no. N auto maker declined to say how many jaguar shares that company owns 
 in late trading friday jaguar shares <unk> the downward tide in london 's stock market and rose five pence to N pence $ N 
 trading volume was a moderately heavy N million shares 
 in the u.s. jaguar 's american depositary receipts were among the most active issues friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $ N each up N cents 
 analysts expect that the two u.s. auto giants will move quickly to buy up N N stakes in jaguar setting up a potential bidding war for the prestigious jaguar brand 
 british government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond N N before the end of N without government permission 
 the british government which owned jaguar until N still holds a controlling golden share in the company 
 with the golden share as protection jaguar officials have rebuffed ford 's <unk> and moved instead to forge an alliance with gm 
 jaguar officials have indicated they are close to <unk> up a friendly alliance with gm that would preserve jaguar 's independence but no deal has been announced 
 ford on the other hand has said it 's willing to bid for all of jaguar despite the objections of jaguar chairman sir john <unk> 
 analysts continued to speculate late last week that ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder 's meeting and urging that the government and jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before december N 
 but a ford spokeswoman in dearborn said friday the company has n't requested such a meeting yet 
 individuals close to the situation believe ford officials will seek a meeting this week with sir john to <unk> their proposal for a full bid 
 any discussions with ford could postpone the <unk> deal headed for completion within the next two weeks 
 the gm agreement is expected to retain jaguar 's independence by involving an eventual N N stake for the u.s. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures 
 jaguar and gm hope to win jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by <unk> it in a way that would n't preclude a full ford bid once the golden share expires 
 there 's either a minority stake package capable of getting jaguar shareholder approval or there is n't said one knowledgeable individual 
 if there is n't the deal wo n't be put forward to shareholders 
 union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a <unk> accord 
 gm 's u.k. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an <unk> port site for its first major engine plant in britain

 of course that was n't the actual conversation the late <unk> activist protest leader and founder of the <unk> ever had with his brother 
 it 's a script <unk> together from interviews by cbs news for a <unk> a dramatic <unk> by an actor of mr. hoffman 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression 
 the segment is soon to be broadcast on the cbs news series saturday night with <unk> chung thus further <unk> the <unk> between <unk> and reality in tv news 
 it is the new journalism come to television 
 ms. chung 's program is just one of several network shows and many more in <unk> that rely on the controversial technique of <unk> events using actors who are supposed to resemble real people living and dead 
 ms. chung 's however is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors 
 abbie hoffman in this case is to be played by hollywood actor paul <unk> who is n't new to the character 
 he was mr. hoffman in a N los angeles production of a play called the chicago conspiracy trial 
 television news of course has always been part <unk> 
 broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in <unk> an audience 
 but as cbs broadcast group president howard <unk> puts it the network now needs to broaden the <unk> of <unk> television and that includes some <unk> 
 since its premiere sept. N the show on which ms. chung appears has used an actor to <unk> the rev. <unk> johns a <unk> leader and one to play a <unk> drug dealer 
 it has <unk> the <unk> of pan am flight N over the scottish town of <unk>

 call it a fad 
 or call it the wave of the future 
 nbc 's <unk> are produced by <unk> productions which also makes the successful prime-time nbc entertainment series <unk> <unk> 
 the marriage of news and theater if not exactly inevitable has been <unk> nonetheless 
 news programs particularly if they score well in the ratings appeal to the networks ' <unk> corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is somewhere between $ N and $ N for a one-hour program 
 entertainment shows tend to cost twice that

 that is n't much compared with what bill cosby makes or even <unk> chung for that matter who is paid $ N million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the <unk> murphy brown

 mr. <unk> says he would n't dream of participating himself 
 no way 
 i think <unk> <unk> 
 though a <unk> may have the flavor hollywood on the hudson it is n't 
 some producers seem tentative about the technique <unk> even 
 so the results while not news are n't exactly theater either at least not good theater 
 and some people do think that acting out scripts is n't worthy of cbs news which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry 
 in his review of saturday night with <unk> chung tom <unk> the tv critic of the washington post and generally an <unk> of cbs wrote that while the show is impressive one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take 
 <unk> events has in general upset news <unk> including former cbs news president richard s. <unk> and former nbc news president <unk> frank former cbs news <unk> walter <unk> and the new dean of the columbia university graduate school of journalism joan <unk>

 this is dangerous and <unk> abbie 's life says ms. <unk> who has had an advance look at the <unk> script 
 it 's a <unk> piece about someone who is not here to defend himself 
 mrs. hoffman says that <unk> makes the truth flexible 
 it takes one person 's account and gives it <unk> 
 cbs news interviewed jack hoffman and his sister <unk> as well as mr. hoffman 's <unk> in <unk> township pa 
 also jonathan <unk> who <unk> with mr. hoffman on two books 
 mr. <unk> says i wanted to be interviewed to get abbie 's story out and maybe talking about the illness will do some good 
 the executive producer of saturday night with <unk> chung andrew lack declines to discuss <unk> as a practice or his show in particular 
 i do n't talk about my work he says 
 the president of cbs news david w. burke did n't return numerous telephone calls 
 one person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of cbs news to comment on a work in progress such as the hoffman <unk> but says cbs news is aware of the concerns of ms. <unk> and mr. hoffman 's former wife 
 neither woman was invited by cbs news to participate in a <unk> discussion about mr. hoffman that is to follow the <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the actor who plays mr. hoffman says he was concerned at first that the script would <unk> an <unk> political mind one that i <unk> but that his concerns were <unk>

 dentsu inc. the world 's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the japanese market is setting its sights on overseas expansion 
 last year dentsu started <unk> a joint network with u.s. ad agency young & rubicam and eurocom of france 
 a few months ago dentsu acquired N N of australian agency fortune communication holdings ltd. for N million australian dollars us$ N million 
 dentsu has u.s. subsidiaries but they keep low <unk> 
 now the giant marketing company which holds N N of japan 's N trillion yen $ N billion advertising industry is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the u.s. or europe 
 what is driving dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its japanese clients as they grow in the u.s. and europe 
 if we do n't do something we wo n't be able to catch up with demand says a dentsu spokesman 
 our president said acquisition is an effective method 
 last year dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than N N of total billings but the company is aiming at N N in the near future 
 so far it appears cautious about taking the big step 
 for example the spokesman says dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled british marketing group saatchi & saatchi plc 
 but he said dentsu has n't looked seriously at saatchi 
 though dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines it is laying the <unk> for international growth 
 it is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad 
 for the year ended march N dentsu sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income jumped N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 dentsu 's billings last year were larger than those of young & rubicam the world 's second-largest ad agency according to a survey by the publication advertising age 
 but success overseas in <unk> markets could be <unk> than for other industries such as manufacturers 
 on its own dentsu 's muscle in japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking <unk> clients

 the big <unk> is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics he said 
 the christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits 
 the council 's report is based on data the trade group buys from the u.s. census bureau 
 the information on N metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as sears roebuck & co. and k mart corp. as well as closely held concerns such as r.h. macy & co

 insurers may see claims resulting from the san francisco earthquake totaling nearly $ N billion far less than the claims they face from hurricane hugo but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months 
 the property claims service division of the american insurance services group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $ N million 
 this estimate does n't include claims under workers ' compensation life health <unk> and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges highways and public buildings 
 the estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $ N billion in claims that insurers face from hurricane hugo which <unk> through the caribbean and the carolinas last month 
 that 's because only about N N of california homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses 
 however insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the bay area earthquake hugo and last week 's explosion at the phillips petroleum co. 's refinery in pasadena texas will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump 
 other insurance rates such as casualty insurance which would cover liability claims are n't likely to firm right away says alice <unk> an industry analyst with <unk> research in avon conn 
 she believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes is n't likely to halt the growth of the industry 's surplus capital next year 
 property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first analysts and brokers believe 
 the reinsurance market has been <unk> by disasters in the u.s. as well as in great britain and europe says thomas <unk> director of research at <unk> lane inc. in atlanta 
 insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses 
 insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm a reinsurance company which in turn <unk> a portion of any losses resulting from this policy 
 insurers such as cigna corp. <unk> corp and aetna life & casualty co. buy reinsurance from other <unk> companies and lloyd 's of london for one catastrophe at a time 
 after hugo hit many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap <unk> to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year 
 after the earthquake two weeks ago brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance <unk> again and lloyd 's syndicates turned to the london market excess lines for protection of their own 
 james <unk> senior vice president of <unk> & <unk> inc. a new york-based reinsurance broker says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for N 
 however companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat or perhaps even decline slightly 
 many companies will be negotiating their N reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks 
 it 's a seller 's market said mr. <unk> of the reinsurance market right now 
 but some large insurers such as state farm mutual automobile insurance co. do n't purchase reinsurance but fund their own program 
 a few years ago state farm the nation 's largest home insurer stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to <unk> 
 the $ N million of losses state farm expects from hugo and an additional $ N million from the earthquake are less than N N of state farm 's $ N billion total net worth 
 since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake it 's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake 's impact on fourth-quarter earnings said herbert <unk> at prudential-bache securities corp 
 <unk> expects an after-tax charge of less than $ N million against fourth-quarter net hartford insurance group a unit of itt corp. expects a $ N million or N cents after-tax charge and fireman 's fund corp. expects a charge of no more than $ N million before taxes and after using its reinsurance

 nicaraguan president daniel ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his u.s. <unk> have failed to do revive a constituency for the contra rebels 
 lawmakers have n't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the contras and president bush <unk> the question at a news conference here saturday saying only that if there 's an <unk> military offensive that 's going to change the equation N degrees 
 but mr. ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a <unk> cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him effectively <unk> the contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the <unk> of their most <unk> supporters 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on <unk> 's meet the press that mr. ortega 's threat was a very <unk> move particularly the timing of it 
 the threat came during a two-day celebration in costa rica to highlight central america 's progress toward democracy in the region attended by president bush canadian prime minister brian <unk> and N other western <unk> leaders 
 mr. bush returned to washington saturday night 
 mr. ortega announced on friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic contra <unk> against his army 
 saturday he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to <unk> by the cease-fire if the u.s. ends its financial support for the contras 
 he asked that the remaining u.s. humanitarian aid be diverted to <unk> and <unk> the rebels 
 not only did mr. ortega 's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a <unk> for the region it came as nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned february elections 
 outside observers are gathering in nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates 
 and important u.s. lawmakers must decide at the end of november if the contras are to receive the rest of the $ N million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the bush administration in march 
 the humanitarian assistance which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels <unk> along the nicaraguan border with honduras replaced the military aid cut off by congress in february N 
 while few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month mr. ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued 
 senate minority leader robert dole r. <unk> said yesterday on meet the press i would hope after his mr. ortega 's act yesterday or the day before we 'd have <unk> support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid 
 sen. dole also said he hoped for <unk> support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow <unk> the nicaraguan leader 
 while renewing military aid had been considered out of the question rejected by congress and <unk> by the bush administration mr. ortega 's statement provides contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue 
 the administration should now state that if the february election is <unk> by the sandinistas they should call for military aid said former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
 in these circumstances i think they 'd win 
 sen. mitchell said that congressional democrats intend to honor the march agreement to give <unk> support to the contras through the february elections although he added that the agreement requires that the contras not <unk> any military action 
 mr. ortega 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as u.s. officials were acknowledging that the contras have at times violated it themselves 
 secretary of state james baker who accompanied president bush to costa rica told reporters friday i have no reason to deny reports that some contras <unk> some sandinista soldiers 
 mr. baker 's assistant for <unk> affairs bernard <unk> while maintaining that the sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire acknowledged it 's never very clear who starts what 
 he added that the u.s. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire 
 in addition to <unk> arguments in favor of ending contra aid mr. ortega 's remarks also played to the <unk> of some u.s. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or <unk> the february elections 
 administration officials traveling with president bush in costa rica interpreted mr. ortega 's <unk> as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections 
 mr. abrams said that mr. ortega is seeking to <unk> the contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections 
 my sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for <unk> down on <unk> by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency he said

 mr. thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the merc 's <unk> reputation as an exchange whose floor traders do n't follow the rules very well 
 ms. <unk> had been forced out in july in a bitter power struggle with <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange 
 mr. <unk> told one person familiar with the new york exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be responsive to the needs of the membership and the board 
 mr. thompson first came to the exchange in N and has been executive vice president since march N 
 he previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel 
 by contrast the comex in july imported a highly regarded outsider arnold f. <unk> as its president 
 mr. <unk> N was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products 
 mr. thompson is n't <unk> of experience with new products however 
 for the past two years he said he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market 
 our members are eager to begin trading this contract so we expect no difficulty in attracting <unk> to the natural gas pit he said 
 the educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two he added 
 the merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in new york and third behind the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 
 in a recent interview mr. thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image 
 earlier this year the u.s. attorney indicted N floor traders and one clerk at the two big chicago exchanges 
 federal authorities in new york started investigating exchanges in may though no <unk> have been handed down there 
 so far they have issued scores of <unk> some of which went to members of the new york merc 
 mr. thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those <unk> 
 in a recent general accounting office study the merc was found to have been the most <unk> in <unk> exchange rules 
 it <unk> the smallest number of <unk> of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years 
 it also had both the <unk> and least experienced investigators per million contracts traded 
 the merc received considerable criticism in N when it was discovered that its compliance director kevin p. conway who then was responsible for <unk> the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits was engaged in other personal business activities on exchange time including <unk> trips according to a new york merc report prepared last year 
 mr. conway is no longer at the exchange 
 we had a management breakdown in N in terms of compliance mr. thompson says 
 we recognized the problem and took care of it 
 he says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly the N business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed 
 for years the five new york exchanges have been talking about <unk> in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations 
 <unk> there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges 
 so far there is little to show for such efforts 
 mr. thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever 
 the cost of competition has become extremely high he says 
 we must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges 
 he thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up 
 one of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them 
 the <unk> has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent <unk> audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud 
 the merc is now <unk> with the comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail 
 the chicago exchanges also are working on such a device 
 another major electronics problem faces mr. thompson the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours 
 in january the new york merc signed a letter of intent with the chicago merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called <unk> 
 but in may the chicago merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the chicago board of trade and it suspended negotiations with the new york merc 
 mr. thompson says his exchange is n't waiting for the results of the chicago exchanges ' cooperation 
 it recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called <unk> the automated trading system created by the international commodities clearing house 
 looking ahead to commodity markets this week 
 copper 
 michael <unk> metals trader for painewebber inc. in new york said there is good technical support between $ N and $ N a pound for december copper which ended friday at $ N a pound up N cents 
 he views the $ N to $ N range as a buying opportunity and considers the market <unk> 
 i think the market could pop up to the $ N to $ N level without too much difficulty he said 
 but he said it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $ N and $ N 
 he noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on wall street 
 william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said for a rally to occur there must be demand from the far east 
 he added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted 
 however to resume the bull trend according to mr. <unk> copper would have to close over $ N 
 he said there are two reports this week that might affect prices the purchasing managers report on wednesday and the unemployment report on friday 
 precious metals 
 friday 's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets according to painewebber 's mr. <unk> 
 most traders will be looking to buy on <unk> he said 
 he thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets 
 according to mr. <unk> floor traders say there is good support for december gold in the $ N to $ N per ounce area around $ N an ounce for december silver and in the $ N to $ N an ounce range for january platinum 
 william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year 
 he said last week 's activity in gold could <unk> a move to $ N an ounce for the december contract 
 he also said traders should keep an eye on the stock market because if the stock market rallies that could <unk> trouble for the precious metals 
 he said traders should be on the <unk> for how metals producers react to this rally 
 i expect to see some selling but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past by selling and <unk> in prices for their production 
 he noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals 
 grains and soybeans 
 prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of u.s. crops by the soviet union 
 in recent weeks warm and dry weather has <unk> the midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the <unk> that were cut by the N drought 
 if the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend many midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the chicago board of trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers 
 that selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest 
 traders will also watch for whether the soviet union continues its traditional fall buying of u.s. grain 
 so far this month the soviets have bought about N million metric tons of u.s. corn 
 there may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for november delivery 
 investors usually do n't want to take physical delivery of a contract <unk> instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it <unk> expiration

 louisiana pacific and georgia pacific said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong <unk> business 
 federal paper board said we 're not as exposed as the popular perception of us 
 the company explained that its main product <unk> <unk> which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes historically does n't have sharp price swings 
 because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump painewebber 's mr. ross says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only N N to N N 
 a company such as federal paper board may be overly discounted and looks <unk> to him he says though he is n't yet recommending the shares 
 wall street is n't avoiding everything connected with paper 
 mr. <unk> recommends <unk> explaining that it is virtually the sole major paper company not <unk> a major capacity expansion and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year

 mr. kume made the earnings projection for fiscal N ending next march N in an interview with u.s. automotive writers attending the tokyo motor show 
 the executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in japan and because of <unk> fluctuations 
 during the next decade mr. kume said nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside japan 
 last year mr. kume said nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles and produced N cars and trucks at its factories in north america europe and australia

 national intergroup inc. said it expects to report a charge of $ N million related to the sale of its aluminum unit 's <unk> division for the third quarter 
 the company said it has agreed to sell the <unk> division for $ N million to <unk> werner co. a closely held firm based in greenville pa

 the municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an <unk> of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers 
 commercial banks and property\/casualty insurers which together own about N N of all municipal bonds have been <unk> their securities for weeks 
 last week traders said there were three institutional sellers for every buyer 
 every day we 're getting new bid lists from would-be sellers one trader said 
 most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply 
 as a result yields on long-term <unk> bonds now stand at about N N of long-term treasury yields the highest such level in more than two years 
 there is incredible negative psychology building in the market said <unk> <unk> a vice president at merrill lynch & co 
 people are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers 
 the yield on a group of N revenue bonds compiled by the bond buyer a trade publication now exceeds N N 
 at this week 's new york city bond sale traders expect yields on the 20-year new york bonds to nearly match the N N yield on 30-year treasury bonds 
 for an investor in the N N federal tax <unk> N N tax-free is the same as N N on a taxable investment 
 that 's a <unk> yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year treasury bonds 
 how quickly things change 
 this past summer investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed <unk> 
 individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices making state and local government debt one of the <unk> types of fixed-income investments during the period 
 but while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value you would n't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings 
 bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors 
 big banks such as chemical bank and chase manhattan which have been taking heavy charges to expand their third world loan-loss reserves are n't looking for tax-exempt income 
 we do n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds said a spokeswoman at chemical 
 in recent weeks traders said chemical has sold more than $ N billion of tax-free bonds 
 the spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its <unk> holdings but could n't immediately confirm the amount 
 insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out 
 there is speculation that property\/casualty firms will sell even more <unk> as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to hurricane hugo and the northern california earthquake 
 fundamental factors are at work as well 
 <unk> bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs 
 the recent natural disasters and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply even as demand <unk> off 
 there is just so much going on that it 's difficult to pick just one factor that 's driving the market said ronald ian heller vice president at first chicago capital markets inc. a subsidiary of first chicago corp 
 some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign 
 mutual funds for example are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues 
 because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market <unk> 
 ms. <unk> believes that the mutual funds are selling <unk> bonds that have a negative <unk> those that have <unk> in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates 
 such bonds she says are those that are <unk> their call date 
 but traders said the market 's tone could pick up this week if new york city 's $ N million bond offering goes well 
 the offering will include $ N million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $ N million of taxable bonds 
 a few weeks ago new york sold $ N million of <unk> 
 new york city bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks 
 on friday some issues fell nearly one point or close to $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the sell-off in new york city bonds was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election 
 the city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling 
 the city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned 
 they 'd like to see some other names in their portfolios said michael s. <unk> first vice president at shearson lehman hutton 
 but he thinks investors may be <unk> to the market 's problems 
 overall he says municipal prices are very cheap and represent an excellent buying opportunity 
 friday 's market activity 
 treasury bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week 's treasury debt auction and rumors that a major japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long-term bonds 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of N N down nearly N point from thursday or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the issue 's yield rose to N N from N N 
 late thursday the treasury said it needed to raise $ N billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week 
 credit market analysts expected the treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ N billion of cash management bills 
 instead the treasury announced it would sell $ N billion of <unk> cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ N billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today as usual but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of thursday 
 by moving the settlement date ahead the treasury can raise money under the $ N trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow after which it <unk> to $ N trillion 
 the market also was hurt by rumors that nippon kangyo <unk> a japanese brokerage firm was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased 
 one dealer said the talk was that the firm sold about $ N million of bellwether 30-year bonds 
 the firm is thought to have purchased up to $ N billion of 30-year bonds in a buying spree on wednesday and the previous thursday 
 dealers say the firm apparently has wanted to <unk> its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30-year bonds by using <unk> <unk> securities corp. as a broker 
 <unk> provides price quotes to telerate systems inc. a widely used electronic system 
 nippon kangyo 's moves <unk> traders and created confusion among potential investors many of whom decided to stay out of the market 
 as a result of its large-scale buying some analysts now say that liquidity or the ability to easily buy and sell has been <unk> in the benchmark treasury bond issue

 <unk> schools get the <unk> daily channel one news program whose four <unk> tv ads during each show have drawn protests from educators 
 subscribers also get the classroom channel which will feature <unk> educational programming similar to some <unk> shows and the <unk> 's channel which will offer <unk> programming for teachers and school administrators and will be supported by advertising 
 whittle has met some resistance 
 the educational network as mr. whittle has named the three programs has been offered to N school districts and whittle continues to negotiate with N districts 
 about N N of the school districts approached have rejected the network 
 mr. whittle said that so far three of the six schools that carried the program in a <unk> test last spring have <unk> to the program 
 one of the test schools <unk> high school in cincinnati rejected the project 
 john <unk> associate director of communications for cincinnati public schools said channel one was rejected because students watching the program did n't fare particularly better on a <unk> current events <unk> than a control school without the program and school <unk> were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired 
 the number of correct responses was N N on the test and school <unk> did n't change much said mr. <unk> 
 the pilot program was received well by teachers and students but there was n't reason enough to sign up 
 we even invited the public to stop by and see the program but there was n't much interest 
 advertisers are showing interest

 twice in two weeks the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ual buy-out <unk> the stock market 
 now stock prices seem to be in a general retreat 
 since <unk> at N on oct. N the dow jones industrial average has lost N points or N N closing friday at N down N 
 the number of issues falling on the new york stock exchange each day is <unk> the number of gainers 
 and the number of stocks hitting new lows far <unk> the number setting new highs 
 but why should an <unk> $ N billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market 
 opinions vary about how important the ual deal was to the market 's health but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the ual plan <unk> revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology 
 if this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it would n't have been greeted with anything like the impact it has had over the past two weeks says dennis <unk> a market strategist at kidder peabody 
 there are of course analysts who view the <unk> that briefly <unk> through investors on oct. N and again on oct. N as <unk> <unk> of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market 
 sure price action is volatile and that 's scary but <unk> stocks are still a good place to be they suggest 
 the reaction to the ual debacle is <unk> says john connolly chief market strategist at dean witter 
 ual is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned 
 the only way you can make it a big deal is to draw <unk> that just do n't make sense 
 he suggests for example that investors may have assumed that just because ual could n't get financing no leveraged buy-outs can get financing 
 carried even further some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing <unk> up stock prices the market would collapse if no more lbos could be done 
 there will still be deals argues mr. connolly 
 there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they 've done in the past but deals wo n't disappear 
 he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls strategic deals in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow but because it 's a good fit 
 and even without deals mr. connolly figures the market would remain healthy 
 he notes for instance that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the N stocks in the dow jones industrial average since N yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high 
 those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up he says 
 even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad in mr. connolly 's view 
 for the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble <unk> to sell stocks in a matter of minutes 
 who can make the better decision the guy who has N seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world he says 
 what on earth does the ual deal have to do with the price of <unk> which i was able to buy on oct. N at a very attractive price 
 kidder peabody 's mr. <unk> also sees some benefits to the stock market 's recent drop 
 we 've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get <unk> he says 
 the balloon had been <unk> up so big that when somebody came along with a <unk> in this case the ual deal we got a little pop 
 the pop <unk> up investors who had been getting a little too <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 it provided an excuse for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data especially the third-quarter economic numbers and to realize that we ca n't continue to <unk> over what is going on in the junk bond market 
 but he figures that at current levels the stock market is <unk> valued even with the economy obviously slowing 
 just because we 've got some <unk> back in the market does n't mean it 's going lower from here he says 
 the bottom line is that it 's healthy to have this kind of <unk> activity especially after a N N gain in stock values over the past N months 
 he 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs 
 maybe maybe not 
 <unk> joseph cohen a market strategist at drexel burnham lambert is n't nearly so <unk> about the market 's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon 
 her view is that stock prices have three major <unk> merger and buy-out proposals earnings and the economic outlook 
 at current levels of economic activity and earnings stocks are fairly valued she says 
 but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that <unk> a vigorous merger and buy-out business and ual has obviously put a <unk> on that 
 stocks are n't cheap anymore there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the <unk> of deals she says 
 i 'm not saying they 've stopped altogether but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high 
 but that 's not the only problem for stocks 
 the other two <unk> earnings and the economic outlook are troubling too 
 <unk> is getting all the <unk> right now but these other things have been building up more gradually she says 
 third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of N is getting worse 
 there are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices she says 
 with all this can stock prices hold their own 
 the question is <unk> at this point she says 
 it depends on what happens 
 if the economy <unk> into a recession then this is n't a level that 's going to hold

 federal investigators have identified the problem in last july 's crash of a united airlines flight in iowa a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk 
 for several months officials at the federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board have suspected that a <unk> flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the <unk> engine to break apart in flight 
 the explosion sent <unk> of metal flying <unk> the <unk> 's <unk> or control systems and led to the crash that killed N people 
 but investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent <unk> of a big chunk of flight N 's <unk> engine from a <unk> near the <unk> city airport in iowa 
 the safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in <unk> city 
 among the issues the board will examine is whether united airlines a unit of ual corp. should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks 
 the engine involved was a <unk> made by general electric co 
 anthony broderick the faa 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw known as hard <unk> occurred in the titanium during its production almost N years ago 
 he said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur 
 the faa already has ordered that all N disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and <unk> to an <unk> test in a <unk> chamber 
 such tests make the faa confident that a <unk> <unk> accident wo n't happen again said mr. broderick 
 a spokesman for ge said that the company has been working with the faa all along on this issue and will comply fully with the required <unk> 
 but he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on ge 's engine production

 researchers at ohio state university and <unk> institute of <unk> and <unk> in china have <unk> samples of <unk> ice in <unk> and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past <unk> than in any similar period in the past N years 
 the ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the earth has <unk> considerably in recent times largely because of <unk> in the air and will warm far more in the century ahead 
 a substantial warming would <unk> some of the earth 's <unk> ice <unk> raising the level of the <unk> and causing widespread flooding of heavily <unk> coastal areas 
 if you can use data to <unk> what happened in the past you have much more confidence in predictions for the future said <unk> thompson a research scientist at ohio state who <unk> for and <unk> the ice samples 
 to compare temperatures over the past N years researchers <unk> the changes in <unk> of two forms of <unk> 
 these measurements can indicate <unk> changes researchers said because the rates of <unk> of these <unk> atoms differ as temperatures change 
 analysis of ice from the <unk> ice cap a <unk> <unk> in <unk> N feet above sea level show that average temperatures were higher in N than in any other <unk> period since before the last ice age mr. thompson said 
 some climate models project that interior regions of asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from <unk> which moderate <unk> changes 
 but the <unk> samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating mr. thompson acknowledged 
 according to greenhouse theories increased carbon dioxide emissions largely caused by burning of fossil fuels will cause the earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from <unk> into space 
 skeptics say that if that 's the case temperatures should have risen fairly <unk> over the past century reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide 
 instead the <unk> <unk> record shows increasing temperatures from N through the early 1950s <unk> temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s then higher temperatures again through last year 
 other <unk> data show similar <unk> swings 
 climate <unk> drastically due to natural causes said mr. thompson 
 but he said ice samples from peru <unk> and <unk> all show substantial signs of warming

 congress sent to president bush an $ N billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by N N while revamping the pentagon budget to move more than $ N million from foreign bases to <unk> projects 
 the fiscal N measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by house and senate defense <unk> committees and at a time of <unk> for the military and concern about the u.s. 's standing in the world economy overseas spending is most vulnerable 
 total pentagon requests for installations in west germany japan south korea the united kingdom and the philippines for example are cut by almost two-thirds while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home 
 the result is that instead of the pentagon 's proposed split of N between domestic and foreign bases the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately N 
 the extra margin for bases in the u.s. <unk> the power of the appropriations committees meanwhile lawmakers used their positions to <unk> as much as six times what the pentagon had requested for their individual states 
 house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten d. miss helped secure $ N million for his state or more than double the pentagon 's budget 
 west virginia home of senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd would receive $ N million four times the military 's request 
 tennessee and north carolina home states of the two democratic chairmen of the house and senate military construction <unk> receive $ N million or N N above the pentagon 's request 
 though spending for iowa and oregon was far less their increases above pentagon requests N N and N N respectively were much greater because of the influence of republicans at critical <unk> 
 the swift passage of the bill which cleared the senate and house on simple voice votes last week contrasts with the problems still facing a more <unk> $ N billion measure funding housing environmental space and veterans programs 
 by an N margin the senate approved the bulk of the spending friday but the bill was then sent back to the house to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit <unk> for the federal housing administration 
 the house democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere 
 appropriations committees have used an <unk> of devices to <unk> as much as $ N billion in spending and as critics have <unk> to these devices the bill can seem like a <unk> <unk> trying to make it past ice and <unk> to reach safer winter <unk> 
 much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal N and in some cases is temporarily <unk> in <unk> accounts in anticipation of being transferred to <unk> areas after the budget <unk> is completed 
 for example a house-senate conference <unk> increased the national aeronautics and space administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $ N million or more than $ N million above what either chamber had previously approved 
 part of the increase would provide $ N million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid <unk> facility in mr. whitten 's mississippi 
 but as much as $ N million or nearly N N of the account is marked for potential transfers to research management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster <unk> 
 the bill 's managers face criticism too for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent 
 conservatives embarrassed by republican <unk> scandals at the department of housing and urban development have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <unk> congress 
 hud secretary jack kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week but received little support from the white house budget office which wants to protect <unk> funding in the bill and has <unk> to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments 
 within discretionary funds for community development grants more than $ N million is allocated to six projects in michigan home state of a subcommittee chairman rep. bob <unk>

 mobil corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the u.s. by as much as N N as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business 
 management advised employees friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by N N or N people 
 the exploration side of the unit has recently <unk> a similar overhaul during which it also lost as many as N employees a company spokesman said in response to questions 
 mobil exploration & producing u.s. inc. the group involved currently has a work force of somewhat less than N 
 a few years ago mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide <unk> 
 but since then u.s. oil production has declined and mobil wants to focus its <unk> efforts overseas 
 mobil <unk> to the <unk> cuts last week when it took a $ N million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring 
 mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters 
 on wednesday mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its u.s. production operation 
 mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year 
 during the coming months <unk> of management will be <unk> away and regional offices will become more <unk> 
 for greater efficiency employees at those locations will be <unk> into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction mobil said 
 the main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations said charles e. <unk> president of the mobil unit 
 field offices at new orleans houston denver midland <unk> <unk> calif. oklahoma city and liberal kan. will be maintained 
 but the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased 
 for instance employment in denver will be reduced to N from N 
 but on the west coast where profitable oil production is more likely than in the <unk> region the <unk> calif. office staff of N will grow by N to N 
 the reorganization will focus on the value and potential of assets mr. <unk> said 
 wanted an investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about 
 with $ N billion of cds maturing this month a lot of people have been <unk> the financial landscape for just such an investment 
 in april when many of them bought their cds six-month certificates were yielding more than N N investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts 
 now the nationwide average yield on a six-month cd is just under N N and N N is about the best around 
 but investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy 
 yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago 
 and the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there 
 if you 're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a cd you 're not going to find it says washington financial planner dennis m. <unk> 
 there are however some alternatives that <unk> investors should consider investment advisers say 
 short-term municipal bonds bond funds and <unk> annuities are some of the choices they mention and not just as a way to get a higher return 
 in particular advisers say investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that cd holders are <unk> right now of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates 
 a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense 
 people should remember their money is n't all or nothing they do n't need to be shopping for the one <unk> investment and putting all their money in it says <unk> md. adviser karen schaeffer 
 here 's a look at some of the alternatives 
 short-term municipals 
 investors with a heavy tax load should take out their <unk> 
 yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years 
 that 's because <unk> interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local taxes too for <unk> investors 
 for an investor paying tax at a N N rate a seemingly <unk> N N yield on a one-year <unk> is equivalent to a taxable N N 
 rates approach N N on five-year municipals 
 some of the more cautious cd holders might like <unk> municipals 
 these securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside u.s. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired 
 it 's a <unk> you do n't have to worry about diversification you do n't have to worry about quality says steven j. <unk> executive vice president of the new york bond firm of <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc 
 consider a <unk> bond portfolio with issues maturing in say N N and N advises malcolm a. <unk> a <unk> r.i. financial planner 
 the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates 
 bond funds 
 bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell 
 that makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price <unk> in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so 
 buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right 
 but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead 
 bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates 
 the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities <unk> 
 consider for instance two bond funds from vanguard group of investment cos. that were both yielding N N on a recent day 
 the short term bond fund with an average maturity of N N years would deliver a total return for one year of about N N if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about N N if rates rise by the same amount 
 but in the same circumstances the returns would be a more extreme N N and N N for the vanguard bond market fund with its N 1\/2-year average maturity 
 you get <unk> returns from bonds if you guess right on rates says james e. wilson a columbia s.c. planner 
 if interest rates do n't change bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields 
 deferred annuities 
 these insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as <unk> individual retirement accounts investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn but a N N penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age N N 
 aimed specifically at cd holders are so-called <unk> annuities or certificates of annuity 
 an interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years after which holders get N days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities 
 some current rates exceed those on cds 
 for instance a <unk> annuity from north american co. for life & health insurance chicago offers N N interest for one year or a N N rate for two years 
 annuities are rarely a good idea at age N because of the withdrawal restrictions 
 but at age N they may be a great deal says mr. wilson the columbia s.c. planner 
 money market funds 
 that 's right money market mutual funds 
 the conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates seem headed down 
 with average maturities of a month or so money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates with a slight lag 
 still today 's <unk> money funds may beat cds over the next year even if rates fall says guy <unk> an editor of the bond market <unk> newsletter in atlanta 
 that 's because <unk> funds currently offer yields almost N N percentage points above the average cd yield

 if rates unexpectedly rise the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund 
 federal drug regulators concerned over british reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to <unk> insulin say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here 
 the united kingdom reports came from dr. patrick toseland head of clinical chemistry at guy 's hospital in london 
 in a telephone interview friday dr. toseland said the number of sudden <unk> deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was N compared with just two in N 
 at least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year he said 
 dr. <unk> <unk> director of <unk> and <unk> drug products for the u.s. food and drug administration said fda officials have discussed dr. toseland 's findings fairly <unk> 
 while there have been no reports of similar sudden <unk> deaths among diabetics in the u.s. dr. <unk> said the fda plans to examine dr. toseland 's evidence and is considering its own study here 
 dr. toseland a <unk> said he was preparing an article for a british <unk> medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin <unk> critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia or low blood sugar which can kill diabetics 
 the usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include <unk> anxiety and <unk> 
 with proper warning diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or <unk> food 
 the <unk> data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid <unk> of hypoglycemia dr. toseland said 
 at the u.s. national institutes of health dr. robert e. <unk> chief of the <unk> program branch said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of N diabetics that has been under way at nih for five years 
 however he said officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia <unk> 
 we are now monitoring for it much more closely he said 
 we do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal <unk> drive down blood sugar dr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster he said 
 but we do n't believe there is enough of a difference to be <unk> significant dr. <unk> said 
 reports of dr. toseland 's findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there 
 both the british <unk> association and the committee on safety in <unk> britain 's equivalent of the u.s. fda recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support dr. toseland 's findings 
 on friday the american <unk> association issued a similar statement urging the six million u.s. diabetics not to <unk> to the british report 
 a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used the american association said 
 the fda already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less <unk> with human insulin than with <unk> products 
 eli lilly & co. the <unk> drug manufacturer dominates the u.s. human insulin market with its product known as <unk> 
 lilly is building plants to make the insulin in indianapolis and <unk> france 
 in its latest annual report lilly said <unk> sales have shown excellent growth 
 lilly officials said they had seen reports of <unk> <unk> among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths 
 dr. <unk> thompson a lilly group vice president said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and <unk> <unk> indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product 
 dr. toseland said most of the british diabetics who died had been taking a <unk> insulin made by <unk> a <unk> manufacturer 
 none of the diabetics were using lilly 's insulin 
 <unk> corp. said it will reduce its <unk> work force by about N N effective tomorrow in an effort to stem continuing losses

 defense intellectuals have complained for years that the pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy 
 last april the new defense secretary richard cheney acknowledged that given an ideal world we 'd have a nice neat orderly process 
 we 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget 
 this city does n't work that way 
 with a five-year defense plan costing more than $ N trillion it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in washington 
 this wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures 
 as it is we identify national goals and the threats to these goals we shape a strategy to counter these threats we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy before finally <unk> the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces 
 these procedures consume millions of <unk> of labor and produce tons of paper and each year their end product the five year defense plan promptly <unk> away 
 the <unk> on the left shows how this happens see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations 
 the pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats 
 strategy however is about possibilities not hopes and dreams 
 by ignoring costs u.s. strategists <unk> their responsibility for hard decisions 
 that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 these people have different <unk> 
 and as a result as the recent vote by the house to undo mr. cheney 's program <unk> suggests the <unk> of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense strategy 
 how can we turn this situation around 
 reform starts in the pentagon 
 strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process 
 they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program 
 they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets 
 they would also identify the best way to add programs should the budget come in at higher levels 
 this kind of <unk> analysis is common in war planning and business planning 
 there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning 
 two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action 
 step N <unk> up our books 
 our five-year plan contains three accounting devices negative money an above <unk> management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates which <unk> the spending the pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ N billion 
 negative money was invented in N to make the N five year defense plan conform to the numbers in president reagan 's final budget <unk> to congress 
 that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ N billion 
 to make the books balance as is required by law somebody invented a new budget line item that simply <unk> $ N billion 
 it is known in the pentagon as the negative wedge 
 the pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ N billion in the <unk> unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ N billion in an above <unk> management reserve that accounts for <unk> programs that will <unk> in the future 
 the N plan also assumes inflation will decline to N N by N 
 most <unk> including those in the congressional budget office assume inflation will be in excess of N N in each of those five years 
 at that rate the defense plan is <unk> by $ N billion 
 by adding the negative wedge and <unk> the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate we arrive at a baseline program costing $ N trillion between N and N 
 step N <unk> how four <unk> lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security 
 the <unk> on the right which assumes a N N rate of inflation places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations 
 step N will answer the question what happens if these increases do not <unk> 
 scenario N known as the constant dollar freeze <unk> the pentagon for inflation only it <unk> upward at N N per year 
 this scenario has been the rough position of the u.s. senate since N and it reduces the baseline by $ N billion between N and N 
 scenario N the current dollar freeze has been the <unk> position of the house of representatives for about four years 
 it <unk> the budget at its current level and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until N 
 this reduces the baseline by $ N billion 
 scenario N <unk> the recent <unk> between the house and the senate it <unk> the difference between scenarios N and N by increasing the budget at N N per year 
 it reduces the baseline by $ N billion 
 finally scenario N reduces the budget by N N per year for the next five years a total reduction of $ N billion 
 this can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction perhaps driven by the <unk> effects of the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a <unk> of <unk> with the soviet union 
 the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario <unk> strengths and <unk> weaknesses 
 they would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan including the assumptions made an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations the impact on national security and the best strategy for working around these limitations 
 this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions 
 if for example they choose to keep the b-2 <unk> bomber they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs such as carrier <unk> or army divisions as they moved toward lower budget levels 
 these <unk> would <unk> priorities by <unk> when the cost of the b-2 became <unk> 
 some may be <unk> to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concept of the carter administration 
 but <unk> did not involve the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff and therefore <unk> into a <unk> drill driven by budget politics 
 anyway <unk> 's procedures were so <unk> that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of <unk> 
 a strategic review is fundamentally different 
 it would be run by the joint chiefs under simple <unk> produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the secretary of defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve u.s. goals 
 it might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to <unk> budget cutting by an irresponsible congress 
 this argument plays well in the atmosphere of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the pentagon and congress and unfortunately there is some truth to it 
 but in the end it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons 
 to say that the pentagon should act <unk> because acting <unk> will <unk> congress into acting <unk> leads to the conclusion that the pentagon should deliberately <unk> its needs in the national interest in other words that it is justified in committing a crime lying to congress because it is morally superior 
 strategy is not a game between the pentagon and congress it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between <unk> or <unk> alternatives 
 if we want meaningful priorities we must understand the <unk> they <unk> before we make commitments 
 strategy is not a separate event in an <unk> <unk> of <unk> events it is a way of thinking that <unk> threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial cultural and physical limitations 
 mr. <unk> is a permanent pentagon official 
 this is a <unk> version of an <unk> that will appear in the january issue of the naval institute proceedings 
 the views expressed do not reflect the official policy of the department of defense 
 although bullish dollar sentiment has <unk> many currency analysts say a massive sell-off probably wo n't occur in the near future 
 while wall street 's tough times and lower u.s. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors 
 by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days says <unk> <unk> a foreign-exchange adviser at credit suisse 
 we 're close to the bottom of the near-term ranges she contends 
 in late friday afternoon new york trading the dollar was at N marks and N yen off from late thursday 's N marks and N yen 
 the pound strengthened to $ N from $ N 
 in tokyo monday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen down from friday 's tokyo close of N yen 
 the dollar began friday on a firm note gaining against all major currencies in tokyo dealings and early european trading despite reports that the bank of japan was seen unloading dollars around N yen 
 the rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation thursday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
 but once the pound <unk> with help from purchases by the bank of england and the federal reserve bank of new york the dollar was dragged down traders say by the stock-market slump that left the dow jones industrial average with a loss of N points 
 with the stock market <unk> and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of u.s. economic weakness and the recent decline in u.s. interest rates that has diminished the <unk> of dollar-denominated investments traders say the dollar is still in a <unk> position 
 they 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar says james <unk> a foreign-exchange marketing representative at bank of montreal 
 while some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at N marks and N yen mr. <unk> and others do n't see the currency <unk> sliding under support at N marks and N yen soon 
 predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after mr. lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar <unk> 
 with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies you do n't have a confirmation that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works says mike <unk> senior currency analyst at <unk> inc. in chicago 
 as far as the pound goes some traders say a slide toward support at $ N may be a favorable development for the dollar this week 
 while the pound has attempted to stabilize currency analysts say it is in critical condition 
 sterling plunged about four cents thursday and hit the week 's low of $ N when mr. lawson resigned from his <unk> post because of a policy <unk> with other cabinet members 
 he was succeeded by john major who friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest rates that he said are working exactly as intended in reducing inflation 
 but the market remains uneasy about mr. major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound currency analysts contend 
 although the bank of england 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that britain 's slowing economy is headed for a recession it is widely believed that mr. lawson 's willingness to <unk> up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks 
 if there are any signs that mr. major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge that currency is expected to fall sharply 
 it 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under major than there were under lawson says malcolm roberts a director of international bond market research at salomon brothers in london 
 there 's very little upside to sterling mr. roberts says but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed mr. major 's appointment apparently has run its course 
 but some other analysts have a <unk> forecast for the pound particularly because britain 's inflation is <unk> at a relatively <unk> annual rate of about N N and the nation is <unk> with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits 
 the pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as N marks within the next year says nigel <unk> an international economist at james capel & co. in london 
 the pound was at N marks late friday off sharply from N in new york trading a week earlier 
 if the pound falls closer to N marks the bank of england may raise britain 's base lending rate by one percentage point to N N says mr. <unk> 
 but such an increase he says could be viewed by the market as too little too late 
 the bank of england indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged friday by declining to raise the official N N <unk> rate that it charges discount houses analysts say 
 pound concerns aside the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another <unk> for the dollar many traders say 
 the dollar has a natural base of support around N yen because the japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks says ms. <unk> of credit suisse 
 the yen 's softness she says apparently stems from japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase u.s. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the japanese government

 efforts by the hong kong futures exchange to introduce a new interest-rate futures contract continue to hit <unk> despite the support the proposed instrument enjoys in the colony 's financial community 
 hong kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time 
 the contract was first proposed more than two years ago but shortly afterward the colony 's markets were hit hard by the october N global stock crash 
 the subsequent drive to reform hong kong 's markets also has <unk> the interest-rate futures contract 
 the securities and futures commission a government <unk> set up after the N crash to try to restore confidence and order to hong kong 's markets had been expected to give the contract conditional approval last week 
 but regulators this week said <unk> officials still have a way to go before they answer all the remaining detailed questions about the contract 
 the exchange had forecast that the contract would begin trading by december 
 but securities regulators now say privately that it is n't likely to start until the first quarter of next year 
 analysts and financial officials in the british colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the hong kong futures exchange which has never fully recovered from the october N crash 
 many believe that without a healthy futures exchange hong kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer 
 in addition local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their hong <unk> exposure 
 the contract will be based on the three-month hong kong interbank offered rate or <unk> 
 it is almost a carbon copy of the chicago mercantile exchange 's eurodollar contract which is based on the three-month eurodollar rate the rate paid on <unk> deposits in london banks 
 if the contract is as successful as some expect it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in hong kong 
 the contract is definitely important to the exchange says robert <unk> executive director of the securities and futures commission 
 two years ago the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers 
 after only N months its main contract based on the hang seng index had grown to be the second-largest <unk> contract in the world 
 a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date 
 in the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures the instruments are given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash 
 but in the week following the N stock crash the exchange <unk> on collapse and the stock and futures markets in hong kong were closed for four days 
 only a <unk> bailout kept the crisis from <unk> the exchange 
 trading in hang seng index futures remains <unk> by the experience 
 volume for the entire month of september totaled only N contracts compared with a daily average of N in the month before the N crash 
 despite the thin trading and after two painful years of restructuring the futures market has shown itself to be <unk> in two recent tests 
 while asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the oct. N plunge in new york stock prices futures trading in hong kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly 
 that was also the case in the days following the june N massacre in beijing which caused a sharp drop in hong kong stock prices 
 there was no problem at all says douglas ford chief executive officer of the futures exchange 
 most important to the contract 's success is the commitment of hong kong 's big financial institutions especially the two leaders <unk> & shanghai banking corp. and the local subsidiary of britain 's standard chartered bank plc 
 the two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract 
 if those two banks are there then the balance of the banking institutions will be there says mr. <unk> the securities and futures commission official 
 colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous hong <unk> exposure 
 even though the currency is pegged to the u.s. dollar with a fixed exchange rate of hk$ N to the american currency the u.s. and hong kong economies do n't always move in lock step making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go 
 in early N when the three-month eurodollar rate was between N N and N N the three-month <unk> rate was as low as N N 
 just a few months ago the three-month eurodollar rate was around N N while three-month <unk> hit highs above N N 
 the <unk> contract <unk> quite a bit of the problem of interest-rate risk in the interbank market says eric <unk> a director of james capel far east ltd. the hong kong arm of the british brokerage firm 
 despite the initial support expected trading in the contract is likely to start slowly 
 the <unk> from the N crash have n't yet <unk> and not all claims against the exchange <unk> by those who bet the hang seng index would fall have been settled 
 companies and financial institutions familiar with hong kong remain wary of trading in its futures market 
 and mr. <unk> <unk> that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the hong kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency 
 he says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading N to N lots a day 
 exchange officials also point out that <unk> futures were designed for institutions and corporations not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in hang seng index futures and defaulted in the N crash 
 mr. <unk> says the low margin required for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors before the N crash who did n't realize that their risk was virtually <unk> 
 you 're not going to get your taxi drivers and <unk> and all that says <unk> nicholas a director for securities company elders bullion & futures ltd

 when the going gets tough it 's tough to trade stocks in continental europe 
 that 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the <unk> on continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence 
 they say the recent market volatility has underscored the <unk> of the way many european exchanges trade stocks 
 the weaknesses of continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on london 's stock exchange which quotes firm trading prices for about N blue-chip issues from N major countries 
 i 'm not saying london covered itself in glory but the events of the past week have certainly exposed europe 's weaknesses says stewart <unk> a director of scottish amicable investment managers in <unk> scotland which manages about # N billion $ N billion in institutional money 
 he says the problems on european exchanges included <unk> <unk> delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading <unk> 
 the events strengthen london 's hand in becoming the center for trading european stocks mr. <unk> says 
 unable to unload a large block of a french blue-chip company 's shares in paris for two days last week a frustrated scottish amicable fund manager finally <unk> down her phone in <unk> and called james capel & co. a london brokerage firm 
 the firm did the trade in seconds on the london stock exchange 's <unk> <unk> system 
 on so-called manic monday oct. N stock prices plunged across europe and trading problems erupted 
 london had some problems too 
 the london exchange 's electronic <unk> system provided only <unk> or <unk> prices for about N minutes on manic monday 
 some dealers say other traders were n't picking up their phones 
 but london 's problems were nothing compared with the continent 's 
 in brussels which recently spent millions of dollars on a <unk> trading system <unk> traders watched <unk> as a software failure before opening on manic monday prevented trading for two days 
 for N hours no one had any idea precisely how much his securities were worth 
 by wednesday frustrated belgian brokers reopened the market by using the <unk> method of <unk> stocks with <unk> on a <unk> 
 the belgian computer system finally was repaired and <unk> on tuesday of this week with the aid of toronto stock exchange officials who developed the system 
 in frankfurt which only has a <unk> daily <unk> session even in the best of times stocks did n't open for the first N minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame on a wave of sell orders from small investors 
 as banks processed <unk> <unk> of sell orders the crush led to manic monday 's worst decline german stocks ended down N N 
 exchange officials extended trading hours N minutes on monday and N minutes on tuesday to clear up order backlogs 
 in france more than half the top N blue-chip stocks including such giants as bsn and <unk> <unk> did n't open until wall street rallied late in the european trading day traders say 
 the rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy orders solving an <unk> problem 
 but by that time many big institutions had switched business to london 
 belgium was closed for two days france closed for a couple of hours germany was stuck 
 it was a nightmare says susan noble an investment manager at robert fleming holdings ltd. 's international investment management unit in london 
 it 's very worrying that these markets ca n't cope 
 on manic monday the volume of german shares traded in london more than tripled to N million and the volume of french shares rose N N 
 by comparison german domestic stock volume in frankfurt only doubled that day 
 the switch to the london market during such <unk> times is significant 
 for one thing the size of the affected market is enormous the european stock markets account for some N N of global stock market capitalization with an estimated value of $ N trillion according to morgan stanley capital international 
 the continental markets alone contribute about N N of estimated world market capitalization of $ N trillion 
 though the widely traded shares that are quoted in london account for only a small portion of those totals they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally 
 the switch to london <unk> the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with european community efforts to develop a single market by N european stock trading remains a highly <unk> and very <unk> activity 
 against this backdrop one thing that does n't seem likely to result from N is a single european stock market 
 rather there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most european financial centers including european giants such as barclays bank plc and deutsche bank as well as merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. of the u.s. and japan 's nomura securities co 
 these firms which often have acquired a local brokerage firm are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to <unk> a trade 
 and senior officials of two u.s. securities houses say they switched trades in european stocks to the london market last week when they could n't <unk> positions on the continent 
 meantime brokers on the continent are worried too mostly by the potential loss of business 
 i would be much <unk> if this volume in german stocks were in frankfurt rather than london says <unk> <unk> head of international equity sales at dresdner bank in frankfurt 
 he acknowledges that spreads were too wide and volumes too light in the extreme conditions on manic monday 
 already the germans appear to be acting at a special meeting on the day of the decline directors of the frankfurt stock exchange voted to extend their trading hours although they have n't decided when or by how much 
 a frankfurt exchange official acknowledging the brokers ' <unk> says the market still feels it <unk> ok during this crash 
 the dutch who had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity say new equipment to solve the problems ought to be installed within a month 
 says a spokeswoman for the brussels <unk> nobody around here will tell you they are happy the system did n't work 
 but it 's just one of those things that happened 
 investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again 
 but for others the <unk> echo the promises made after the N stock crash when similar problems led many markets to develop the new systems that performed so badly last week 
 they all said they invested huge amounts of money 
 but they either did n't buy the right machines or they wasted it says fleming 's ms. noble

 european community employers fear that the ec commission 's plans for a charter of fundamental social rights is a danger to industrial competitiveness 
 we do n't want brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful said <unk> <unk> secretary general of the employers ' confederation <unk> 
 <unk> an <unk> for the union of industrial and employers ' <unk> of europe fears that the charter will force ec countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations 
 workers and management mr. <unk> said would lose the flexibility and diversity that has so far allowed them to <unk> to local conditions and <unk> 
 the british government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form 
 it argues as does <unk> that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level 
 france will propose a slightly <unk> version of the charter to be discussed by ec <unk> ministers on monday officials said 
 but the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over britain 
 we still have serious differences with the text a british official said because it provides for a regulation of the labor market 
 mr. <unk> said the charter would put poorer ec countries such as spain greece and portugal at a disadvantage 
 it would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours and provide for collective bargaining and worker participation in major corporate decisions 
 this he warned would prevent these countries from <unk> the difference with their richer ec <unk> 
 indeed lower wages in greece they are a third of the ec average are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries 
 increasing labor costs mr. <unk> argued would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the <unk> ec market planned for after N 
 but the <unk> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both britain and european industry is n't an <unk> goal 
 the charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights without seeking to impose any <unk> 
 a key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an action program detailing on what points ec member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter 
 this provision lies at the heart of the british and <unk> fears of social engineering by the commission 
 one possible political solution an ec official said would be for the commission to present the action program in late november before the adoption of the charter at a summit of ec governments on dec. N and N 
 this would leave britain free to adopt the charter after having <unk> the action program 
 the charter was approved by the ec commission on sept. N

 after a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices <unk> budget cuts and sweeping layoffs fear is finally leaving the oil patch 
 independent <unk> are <unk> sinking <unk> into the earth 's <unk> again 
 some in big oil are easing the grip on their <unk> 
 investment capital is creeping back and oil properties are <unk> more 
 <unk> prices are even <unk> up 
 what happened 
 in <unk> terms stability has quietly settled into international oil markets 
 mideast politics have <unk> down and the <unk> within the organization of petroleum exporting countries seems under control for now 
 the fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices says victor <unk> an arthur <unk> & co. oil expert 
 after years of wild swings oil prices over the last N months have settled at around $ N to $ N a barrel 
 that is n't the $ N that <unk> producers a decade ago or the $ N that pleased users a year ago 
 but it is high enough to <unk> the search for future supplies low enough to promote consumption and most important steady enough for both producers and users to believe in 
 not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again 
 the current <unk> is fragile and depends on steady strong demand and continued relative harmony within opec producer of more than N N of the <unk> world 's crude 
 a recession or new opec <unk> could put oil markets right back in the soup 
 also the new <unk> are <unk> and some question their extent 
 drilling activity is still far below eight years ago there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink 
 with all this even the most wary oil men agree something has changed 
 it does n't appear to be getting worse 
 that in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic says glenn cox the president of phillips petroleum co 
 though modest the change reaches beyond the oil patch too 
 the same roller-coaster prices that halted u.s. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets 
 now at least some <unk> has returned for everyone from economists to <unk> 
 corporate planners can plan again 
 management does n't want surprises notes jack <unk> who as <unk> director at american airlines buys some N billion gallons of jet fuel a year 
 prices had been so unstable that two years ago mr. <unk> gave up on long-term forecasts 
 and consumers should be comfortable adds w. <unk> moore u.s. deputy secretary of energy 
 i do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a <unk> rise in the price 
 the catalyst for all this has been opec 
 about a year ago it ended an <unk> <unk> internal production war that had put prices on a roller <unk> and pitched oil towns from houston to <unk> into recession 
 saudi arabia opec 's <unk> abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish <unk> 
 about the same time the <unk> war which was <unk> oil markets ended 
 in addition global petroleum demand has been climbing 
 it is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day or up to N N annually for years to come 
 for opec that 's ideal 
 the resulting firm prices and stability will allow both producers and consumers to plan <unk> says saudi <unk> oil minister <unk> <unk> 
 opec <unk> <unk> explains consumers offer security of markets while opec provides security of supply 
 this is an <unk> time to find mutual ways to prevent price shocks from happening again he says 
 to promote this balance opec now is finally <unk> a <unk> internal problem 
 at its november meeting it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy persian gulf members that can produce far more oil than their <unk> 
 being held well below capacity greatly <unk> them and has led to widespread cheating 
 opec has repeatedly raised its <unk> production ceiling to <unk> some of that unauthorized output 
 oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway 
 but if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem production could increase to N million or N million barrels a day making for a very troublesome first quarter warns <unk> <unk> a consultant and former <unk> opec delegate 
 that would send prices <unk> from what some <unk> u.s. oil executives still regard as too low a level 
 patrick <unk> early president of amoco corp. 's <unk> unit says that despite recent stability he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending

 mitchell will get a <unk> in the oil 
 a kind of <unk> mentality had been <unk> activity says don <unk> mitchell 's oil exploration chief 
 now everybody is a lot more optimistic 
 one attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the <unk> cost of drilling and equipment reflecting service companies ' <unk> for work 
 <unk> oil co. a small texas independent is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others 
 one of its wells in southwestern oklahoma is a rank <unk> a risky well where oil previously has n't been found 
 at this price $ N plus or minus and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago the economics are pretty good says george <unk> head of the company 
 if you know you 've got stability in price you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years 
 the activity is enough to move some <unk> prices back up a little 
 some <unk> prices have risen N N in the past month 
 in the gulf of mexico a boat to deliver supplies to offshore <unk> now costs around $ N a day up nearly N N since june 
 some service <unk> recently were auctioned for about $ N million each up from less than $ N million two years ago 
 at the bottom of the slump <unk> inc. was discounting N N on an electronic evaluation of a well now it discounts about N N <unk> say 
 still there is money to be made 
 most oil companies when they set exploration and production budgets for this year forecast revenue of $ N for each barrel of crude produced 
 prices have averaged more than $ N a barrel higher than that not a <unk> but at least a <unk> bonus for them 
 so according to a dun & bradstreet corp. survey companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end 
 it says N N of those surveyed report that N exploration spending will exceed N 's 
 funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable

 contractors such as parker drilling co. are raising cash again through stock offerings and for the first time in years two <unk> companies recently went public 
 they are grace energy corp. of dallas and marine drilling co. of houston 
 most oil companies are still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs they slashed so deeply

 contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on john r. dorfman 's recent money matters article pros hit <unk> right where it <unk> oct. N i was able to stand <unk> before my <unk> finance students and <unk> that the findings of your <unk> experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom 
 in particular i do not find the fact that your group of pros ' monthly <unk> of four stocks <unk> the market in general to be <unk> with market efficiency 
 mr. dorfman states that an investor who invested $ N a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later purchasing the four new pro picks and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ N excluding account dividends taxes and commissions 
 in contrast an investor holding the dow jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $ N 
 accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation 
 accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments 
 thus rather than seeing the excess returns to the <unk> portfolio as being <unk> i see those returns as simply <unk> for taking on added risk 
 i believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large 
 if you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return i would select a stock with the greatest amount of <unk> risk as i am sure your pros do 
 your hypothetical investor is simply being <unk> for taking on this added risk 
 moreover your hypothetical investor has <unk> the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio 
 a <unk> portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk 
 this means the returns can vary a great deal 
 mr. dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of <unk> <unk> would have accumulated only $ N by <unk> <unk> four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month 
 scott e. <unk> texas <unk> university <unk> texas your investment <unk> article misses the target 
 the fact that stock pickers have <unk> a <unk> selected portfolio in eight of N months has no bearing on the <unk> theory 
 what matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio 
 for example your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are on average N N riskier than holding the market portfolio according to value line 's beta estimates 
 james morgan 's pick for october <unk> is a substantial N N riskier than the market portfolio his <unk> <unk> <unk> pick is N N riskier

 the <unk> also have set off a controversy involving the airlines 
 agents say airlines which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets should be doing more to catch the thieves by <unk> the tickets when they 're used

 they ought to be able to do this 
 but airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized <unk> to check tickets at the gate 
 texans get reasonable car rental insurance 
 consumer advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance 
 now a new law in texas seems to be providing the proof 
 the law the first of its kind requires car rental companies in texas to charge only reasonable rates for <unk> waiver insurance 
 specifically the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars 
 before the law went into effect last month car rental companies were charging as much as $ N a day for the waiver in texas 
 now they 're charging as little $ N a day 
 if they 're telling the truth now then they 've been charging N N more than what is reasonable says steve <unk> an assistant state attorney general in texas 
 a spokesman for hertz corp. acknowledges the waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers but a source of revenue 
 but hertz points out that at least it 's now charging only $ N a day in texas while some competitors are charging $ N

 flight attendants lag before jets even land 
 if your flight <unk> seems a little <unk> it may be because he or she has been working N straight hours 
 a recent study for the federal aviation administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work N hours or more straight despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to N hours 
 some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in <unk> work days the study found 
 this happens because the faa does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants by contrast it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers usually to a maximum of N consecutive hours 
 as far as the faa is concerned says <unk> <unk> air safety director at the association of flight attendants flight attendants can work an <unk> number of hours 
 experts say such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk 
 for instance tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation 
 at the end of their day they are <unk> says john <unk> president of the aviation safety institute a <unk> group in <unk> ohio 
 they have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation 
 in response to the study the faa says it is considering changing its policy or lack of it on flight attendants 
 the agency may not have much choice a congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight <unk> duty time to N hours on u.s. flights and N hours on international trips

 why do you continually ignore the <unk> effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation 
 why do you maintain the house-passed capital-gains plan is a temporary reduction when it is not 
 i think the reason is that you are confusing tax rates with tax payments 
 your sept. N page-one story on the house-passed capital-gains plan is a good example 
 you lead readers to believe that the house reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only 
 you virtually ignore the <unk> power of indexation which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate 
 the monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation tax rate times inflation rate times basis for the gain 
 depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the N N rate without indexation 
 but in any event and this is the important point tax payments on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law even though the tax rate is the same under both systems 
 as you can see the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the house would not be temporary but permanent 
 i hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and in my view most beneficial feature indexation 
 rep. robert k. <unk> r. calif washington 
 that the <unk> for the two-year reduction to N N is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest 
 the reduction <unk> the burden on portfolio changes and <unk> capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses 
 but what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after N 
 to argue that this is not likely to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense 
 a large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation and the taxation of <unk> capital gains is <unk> 
 does the journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest

 the financial accounting standards board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments 
 but the chief <unk> body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain <unk> items related to <unk> sheet instruments 
 the <unk> detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures 
 under the initial proposal for example banks would have been required to disclose that portion of <unk> for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted 
 the final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the <unk> for loan losses which appears on the balance sheet 
 the fasb rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps financial guarantees <unk> interest rate contracts loan contracts loan commitments and options written on <unk> held 
 it will require companies to <unk> out in more detail collateral <unk> and <unk> of credit risk for all financial instruments

 poughkeepsie savings bank said a plan to sell its south carolina branch offices to first citizens bank of columbia s.c. fell through

 a potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of italian u.s. and japanese scientists 
 the team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the <unk> produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough 
 laboratory tests showed that <unk> versions of the <unk> are capable of <unk> an <unk> to whooping cough the researchers reported in this week 's issue of the journal science 
 the current vaccine for whooping cough or pertussis is part of the <unk> for <unk> pertussis <unk> shot given most <unk> and young children 
 the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still <unk> about N million children a year world-wide causing an estimated one million deaths 
 the vaccine however causes <unk> reactions that can be fatal 
 the reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole <unk> pertussis bacterium which causes whooping cough 
 this bacterium produces a toxin that if used as a vaccine can induce <unk> to whooping cough 
 unfortunately the toxin is also <unk> 
 the <unk> scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the pertussis toxin which could be used as a safe vaccine 
 the researchers reported they have been able to <unk> the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium 
 it turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin only one was responsible for the toxin 's <unk> 
 ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes minus the one that caused the <unk> would have been transferred to another bacterium called e. <unk> which would then produce a <unk> version of the toxin 
 the researchers said they did this but the toxin did n't induce <unk> to whooping cough 
 the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a <unk> in the one gene that caused <unk> 
 then using a new technique called <unk> <unk> for introducing genes into cells they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis <unk> 
 these <unk> <unk> ordinarily do n't make the toxin 
 but the genes were accompanied by a piece of dna called a <unk> that turns the genes on 
 the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which because of the <unk> <unk> gene was no longer toxic

 at a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into west germany 's financial center the opening of a <unk> office on a frankfurt side street should n't attract much attention 
 unless of course it happens to be run by the rothschilds 
 after an <unk> absence from the <unk> of the family banking empire the return of the rothschild group to frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights <unk> reporters and a mayoral reception in town hall 
 like other foreign banks establishing a presence here the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services <unk> in europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of european community markets after N 
 yet the rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision 
 in N mayer <unk> rothschild founded <unk> <unk> rothschild & sons and later sent his four sons to london paris vienna and <unk> to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century 
 the original bank in frankfurt closed in N after the death of <unk> carl von rothschild and the family 's banking activities focused on london and paris 
 <unk> <unk> de rothschild the family 's <unk> spokesman explains that by the end of the 19th century berlin had replaced frankfurt as germany 's financial center 
 yet the chief reason for the <unk> he says was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the rothschild name without a rothschild in its management 
 at the time we had only daughters explains the <unk> <unk> so we had to close the bank 
 much of the family 's <unk> remained 
 although its <unk> residence was destroyed by <unk> during world war ii the rothschilds ' place in frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the rothschild name 
 the family 's long absence is <unk> 
 the family was in allied countries during both world war i and the long period of economic <unk> of the 1920s 
 during the third reich the rothschilds were a target of <unk> propaganda against jewish financiers 
 the <unk> pursued the rothschilds across europe as the <unk> grabbed countries <unk> the family 's property in the process 
 american journalist william l. <unk> in his book the rise and fall of the third reich wrote of how in vienna he had <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> men <unk> off silver <unk> paintings and other <unk> from the rothschild palace 
 in the immediate postwar years the rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other european operations delaying their return to frankfurt 
 for a member of the rothschild family the return to frankfurt is a very meaningful event although it might not mean as much to german banking as it means to us says <unk> david de rothschild <unk> 's younger <unk> and a partner in rothschild & cie banque in paris 
 indeed the competition is n't greatly concerned 
 it would be surprising if they did n't come to frankfurt in time for N and they bring an interesting tradition 
 but the market really is n't going to be stood on its head said a banker at one of frankfurt 's big three banks 
 the return of the rothschilds is modest 
 the new representative office with one manager and two <unk> none a member of the rothschild family will carry out no banking operations of its own 
 instead it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family 's mainstay banking units <unk> <unk> rothschild & sons ltd. in london rothschild & cie. in paris and rothschild bank ag in zurich 
 the constraints do n't bother the office 's <unk> manager erich <unk> 
 he left his job as general manager of shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. 's frankfurt office because he says when the rothschilds called i could n't resist 
 each rothschild bank is linked by family ties and <unk> 
 in march <unk> <unk> rothschild in london and rothschild bank in zurich showed assets of # N billion $ N billion and N billion swiss francs $ N million respectively 
 the paris bank does n't publish that figure 
 in europe the rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as european industry <unk> ahead of N 
 yet the group 's limited resources makes it a niche player 
 obviously there are <unk> limitations on the assistance we can provide concedes <unk> david de rothschild but we feel we have some cards to play 
 among them he says is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and <unk> in banking and industry throughout europe and beyond 
 the rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an <unk> of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors 
 as at the zurich bank the minimum investment for individuals will be high about a million german marks $ N three times what many other west german investment banks require 
 but we do make exceptions says a smiling <unk> <unk> de rothschild especially if they are very young and have very rich parents 
 as program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations a few people on wall street say it is time to consider extreme measures 
 the real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices they say might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures 
 a stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks such as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 since stock futures were created in N trading on the chicago mercantile exchange and other exchanges has <unk> to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves 
 the conventional view as voiced by goldman sachs & co. partner <unk> black is that stocks and <unk> such as futures and options form a single market and that <unk> make it a more liquid market 
 but increasingly people are questioning that view and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors 
 warren buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in N 
 and mario <unk> another star in the investing world says my gut says the <unk> of futures and <unk> far outweigh the benefits 
 like others mr. <unk> says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks they will move away from stocks as many have already done 
 and those who remain he says will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies 
 essentially the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps 
 one group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility the other contends that futures are a <unk> of speculation that <unk> from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital 
 before futures says new york investor michael <unk> you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any <unk> value 
 while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices traders now routinely check the futures markets in chicago before they buy or sell stocks 
 when chicago futures prices jump up or down the new york stock exchange follows 
 on tuesday for instance the dow jones industrial average plunged N points in little more than an hour 
 then in the space of a <unk> coffee break the average rallied almost all of the way back 
 paul <unk> who manages more than $ N billion of investments at <unk> capital management inc. blames futures markets for leading the way 
 the fundamentals do n't change in an hour he says 
 i think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing 
 index arbitrage the <unk> buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility 
 although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets john <unk> managing partner of edward d. jones says too much liquidity is n't a good thing 
 the kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day 
 it 's too <unk> he says 
 it is n't investing 
 but stock-index futures have plenty of support 
 defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks 
 they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures 
 and defenders say few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising 
 louis <unk> managing director in charge of equity options and futures at salomon inc. says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s a decade before the advent of futures 
 futures he says merely cut down on trading costs 
 he says blaming futures is like blaming the <unk> 
 since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he says 
 futures do n't need defending says andrew <unk> a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange which trades the s&p N by far the largest stock-index futures contract 
 despite the current outcry over stock market volatility few people expect stock futures to disappear 
 for one thing the chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout including many friends in congress 
 and traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape 
 all life is about change either you <unk> or die says one chicago futures trader 
 if futures are n't permitted here we 'll take it to australia or tokyo 
 average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts 
 based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion 
 by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion 
 many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios 
 if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts

 many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios 
 if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts 
 and although criticism of futures generally comes from wall street one chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions 
 one reason futures are said to add volatility is that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down 
 margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about N N 
 for $ N million you can move $ N million of stocks a specialist on the big board <unk> 
 that gives futures traders a lot more power 
 by contrast an investor in stocks must put up N N in cash 
 some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses 
 thus they say futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most 
 the s&p N index futures transferred the identity of N stocks into one unit making them a simple commodity to trade says george <unk> senior vice president at a. webster <unk> in philadelphia

 of course portfolio trading the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks also <unk> stocks as <unk> commodities 
 there is a class of investor that wants to be exposed to the whole market says <unk> <unk> assistant vice president at travelers investment management co 
 the s&p futures are merely a cheaper and <unk> way to get access to all N stocks he says 
 the big board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the s&p N stocks 
 but owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks 
 stockholders as a group can win because they own a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices 
 futures on the other hand are a zero sum game a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices 
 you do n't own anything says stephen boesel a money manager for t. rowe price in baltimore 
 you 're making a pure bet on the market

 gm sought u.s. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ N million worth of jaguar shares but does n't own any yet according to gm officials here and at the company 's detroit headquarters 
 the no. N u.s. auto maker then wrote jaguar that it intends to go to that N N level once it wins the u.s. clearance to go beyond $ N million a jaguar spokesman said yesterday 
 the gm move follows tuesday 's declaration by ford which holds an unwelcome N N stake in jaguar that it is prepared to bid for the entire company 
 gm is close to completing a friendly deal with jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual N N stake and joint manufacturing ventures 
 speculative investors betting on an imminent clash between ford and gm pushed up jaguar 's share price five pence eight u.s. cents to a <unk> N pence $ N in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday

 but an <unk> bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely 
 we will not go over a certain level said david n. <unk> ford 's vice president for finance at a news conference yesterday in dearborn mich 
 there 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding

 ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties

 it has <unk> a golden share only once before during british petroleum co. 's # N billion $ N billion takeover of <unk> plc in N

 the conservatives do n't <unk> jeopardize marginal <unk> seats in <unk> where jaguar has headquarters nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to <unk> most of britain 's water and electricity industries 
 prime minister margaret thatcher might however be <unk> to any request by jaguar chairman sir john <unk> for the restriction 's early removal to let gm <unk> more than N N or mount a friendly suitor bid against ford

 swedish <unk> and <unk> group ab skf said its pretax profit rose N N to N billion kronor $ N million in the first nine months from one billion kronor $ N million in the corresponding period a year earlier 
 skf said sales increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion 
 earnings per share were N kronor compared with N kronor 
 skf said demand for the group 's main product rolling bearings remained favorable in europe which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales 
 latin american markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year skf said 
 the company said the situation in the u.s. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings 
 analysts said skf 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of N billion to N billion kronor 
 the three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development 
 sales of rolling bearings increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year 
 we read with interest robert <unk> 's sept. N page-one article on robert redford the <unk> kid gets little respect around <unk> 
 <unk> conversations with us mr. <unk> argued that mr. redford 's environmental views are at odds with utah residents 
 this may have been true N years ago but times have changed even in utah 
 mr. redford no longer stands out as an <unk> 
 he has not changed but those around him have 
 many of his views on the protection of <unk> areas <unk> and <unk> are now embraced by mainstream conservative <unk> 
 recently some N environmental and <unk> groups representing such <unk> points of view as the sierra club the league of women voters and the national <unk> association joined together to request a <unk> of the environmentally <unk> central utah project 
 while utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism public views toward the environment have significantly improved 
 in one of the most conservative republican states in the entire nation the <unk> of robert redford 's neighbors is the real story that mr. <unk> missed

 if mr. redford wanted to be accepted by the people of utah he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences 
 furthermore his actions <unk> that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through <unk> construction coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment but it is just fine and <unk> for him to transform a mountain high in the <unk> range into a ski resort

 when president bush <unk> to costa rica today he 'll go with little of the fanfare that <unk> many of his foreign <unk> 
 but the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in central america 
 some conservatives say mr. bush should n't make the trip during which he will participate in costa rica 's celebration of N years of democracy 
 these critics object to mr. bush 's participation in a meeting that includes nicaraguan president daniel ortega among the guests 
 in addition they argue he wo n't help washington 's standing in the region by <unk> the u.s. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an <unk> role in the failed coup attempt in panama 
 i believe it will do more damage than good because it will <unk> people like daniel ortega says <unk> windsor who served as u.s. ambassador to costa rica during the reagan administration 
 mr. windsor among other analysts connected to the conservative heritage foundation fears the gathering of N leaders mostly from central american nations will force mr. bush to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the u.s. failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
 at the same time liberal and moderate democrats note the irony of mr. bush 's joining a celebration of costa rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in u.s. aid to the tiny country 
 the administration proposed only $ N million in so-called economic support funds for costa rica this year down from the $ N million the u.s. provided last year 
 the administration said improvements in costa rica 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $ N billion foreign debt 
 but costa rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices combined with the country 's continuing struggle to <unk> its economy make the support as necessary as ever 
 we are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side said <unk> <unk> an economic affairs specialist at the costa rican embassy in washington 
 democrats argue that costa rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that mr. bush is attending the celebration this weekend to reward the country for its stability in a region <unk> with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in nicaragua 
 however peace efforts by costa rican president <unk> arias have n't always helped the country 's cause in washington 
 mr. arias 's <unk> refusal to support the u.s. 's campaign against leftist nicaragua earned him the <unk> of the reagan white house 
 and more recently he insisted on signing a <unk> agreement intended to <unk> nicaragua 's <unk> contra rebels faster than the bush administration would prefer 
 i think bush 's going there is a helpful sign said sen. terry sanford d. n.c a member of the foreign relations committee who pushed to provide costa rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year 
 lawmakers in both houses support the higher level 
 administration officials defend mr. bush 's decision to make the trip 
 while they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by mr. ortega they insist that mr. bush wo n't be extending the nicaraguan leader any special <unk> 
 the administration also made clear its continuing <unk> for the leftist nicaraguan government in recent days <unk> a package of electoral aid to the nicaraguan opposition renewing the u.s. trade <unk> against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region 
 officials also insist mr. bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region fighting illegal drugs and <unk> the less developed countries 
 let me say there is a <unk> component to this trip secretary of state james baker told reporters wednesday 
 there wo n't be any formal resolutions or <unk> i do n't think 
 but we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many many very important issues 
 in N the presidents commission of the ncaa which oversees most u.s. <unk> sports contracted with the washington-based american institutes for research to do a survey on the college <unk> of what the body chooses to call <unk> 
 a brief executive summary was issued last april and attracted some but not much attention 
 <unk> reports followed and attracted even less notice 
 i suspect i may be one of the few people to have read them all 
 the sixth and last report now is out and it puts the effort in perspective 
 titled comments from students it focuses on the real shame of college sports what happens to young athletes once they enter <unk> 
 it 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible 
 the previous five reports were mainly statistical but clear enough in <unk> 
 they showed that participants in division i football and men 's basketball the big-time revenue sports entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than <unk> <unk> and students who participated in other <unk> activities and they got lower grades once they got there at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them 
 the football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and <unk> combined N hours a week <unk> N 
 almost half N N reported suffering mental abuse from coaches and almost <unk> N N said they had been pressured to ignore injuries 
 but even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words 
 the composite portrait that emerges is n't of a <unk> <unk> marking time until he can land a <unk> pro contract he 's part of a tiny minority 
 rather it 's of a kid we 're talking about N to N year <unk> here having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college 
 the <unk> question coming at the end of a lengthy confidential <unk> was this are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about 
 of the almost N athletes surveyed N took the time to respond 
 here are a few of their answers they say that i am a <unk> but really i 'm an <unk> 
 they <unk> to me on the recruiting trip 
 football is the no. N thing here 
 junior football player 
 being a <unk> at college is a lot different from high school 
 first the sport you play is no longer a game it becomes a job 
 your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress 
 you become <unk> 
 your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance 
 freshman basketball player 
 the coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes not treat us like pieces of meat 
 they always say to get a degree first but they do n't allow us time or to <unk> practice to study for a test 
 they just want to get their job done at any cost to the <unk> 
 freshman football player 
 the pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence such as <unk> and <unk> by coaches 
 some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large <unk> of animals 
 in other words they treat you like a piece of meat 
 <unk> football player 
 playing <unk> sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others 
 we are almost left out of campus social activities 
 this mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring 
 freshman football player 
 you talk about free time <unk> free time 
 time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with football meetings lifting <unk> <unk> or films 
 there is no recovery period it 's go go go 
 abuse to our bodies is overwhelming 
 with our schedule it 's hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen the next day 
 junior football player 
 physical <unk> and depression are common in my life and in some of my <unk> ' lives 
 football player class unspecified 
 more often than not college athletes go through college never really experiencing <unk> life to the <unk> 
 one has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part not a whole of the <unk> 's life 
 <unk> basketball player 
 somehow and i do n't know how the game needs to be played for fun again and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative tv contracts 
 <unk> football player 
 there have been <unk> that at long last changes may be in the works 
 the knight foundation of <unk> ohio has established a national commission to look into <unk> reform and the ncaa presidents commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to N games from N 
 the key word in that <unk> though is may 
 ncaa executive director richard <unk> in accepting a place on the knight commission urged that the panel take a balanced view which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the ncaa 's full convention in january which will vote on them 
 i read that one <unk> athletics director predicted that the <unk> proposal could fail because of real world <unk> economic considerations 
 but the real world also includes the <unk> truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have <unk> and won 
 if they wo n't change their ways voluntarily maybe somebody bigger congress should make them 
 they want <unk> <unk> to the <unk> labs 
 they want a 24-hour library 
 and like college <unk> everywhere they are talking about a demonstration where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands classroom style 
 such is the fiber of the <unk> that <unk> intellectuals let fly at <unk> of harvard university 's new society of <unk> and <unk> or song 
 <unk> are mad as <unk> about campus <unk> and they are n't going to take it anymore at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first 
 we could have called ourselves the academic intellectual society but then everyone would have said oh you mean the <unk> club <unk> <unk> song 's <unk> adviser told N <unk> at the club 's <unk> meeting earlier this month 
 membership has since swelled to between N and N 
 some people may think of <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> individuals with <unk> <unk> for their pencils and a <unk> with computers and matters <unk> 
 <unk> by at least one definition are <unk> circus <unk> 
 but song founder <unk> <unk> a harvard junior thinks of <unk> and <unk> more as <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 one of the group 's first projects is a <unk> hot line that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying 
 the club plans to show <unk> movies such as real <unk> in which physics <unk> pop corn with <unk> and naturally the <unk> of the <unk> a tale of college males with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 one of its more ambitious goals is to get <unk> <unk> the los angeles high-school <unk> teacher featured in the film stand and deliver to come to harvard for a guest <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at harvard 
 so mr. <unk> says high priority is being given to creating a computerized <unk> service where instead of being matched for eye color you could be matched for similar intellectual interests 
 for instance 
 i 'm a <unk> major but i want to know about <unk> 
 hopefully i 'd find someone in <unk> who wanted to know more about <unk> 
 it could work 
 meanwhile finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem 
 <unk> savings bank of new york was cleared by the federal deposit insurance corp. to acquire <unk> savings bank of <unk> n.j. the banks said

 environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in <unk> spending plans as the price of crude does 
 in the wake of the exxon <unk> spill in march new <unk> drilling bans are sharply <unk> exploration in promising locations offshore and in alaska 
 at the same time moves toward tighter <unk> standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do n't <unk> as much as fuel refined from heavy <unk> generally high in <unk> 
 over the years the world 's stream of oil has been growing heavier 
 so the scramble is on for lighter <unk> <unk> and for natural gas in the u.s. 
 recently saudi arabia and venezuela traditional <unk> producers have <unk> of new finds of light <unk> oil by their national oil companies 
 venezuela has also earmarked $ N million in new money for <unk> exploration 
 and some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies 
 typical is <unk> <unk> <unk> italy 's state-owned energy company which not long ago acquired through its agip oil subsidiary a N N share in the consortium accounting for half of <unk> 's oil output 
 agip already has an oil stake in libya 
 both countries produce high-quality <unk> <unk> especially <unk> to making <unk> motor fuel at minimum refining cost 
 franco <unk> <unk> chairman looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry he calls it a revolution requiring huge investments as a result of environmental issues 
 he made a special trip to examine u.s. environmental trends because they are often followed in europe 
 <unk> needs to know what 's coming as it prepares to spend some $ N billion on upgrading its refineries he says 
 oil companies world-wide will have to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required says john h. <unk> the president of the petroleum industry research foundation 
 it will go for work ranging from refinery <unk> to changes in the distribution system including the way service stations pump fuel into cars 
 in the u.s. the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves 
 alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil 
 until the tanker spill big oil was slowly convincing authorities it could <unk> produce from such places 
 now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry possibly for years 
 similarly a group of companies led by chevron corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the california coast in the early 1980s 
 a huge production system built in the sea off santa barbara and <unk> is sitting idle 
 but the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the <unk> of natural gas 
 more than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a fuel that is cleaner to <unk> than either oil or coal 
 activity has revived in the largest u.s. <unk> regions such as the gulf of mexico 
 santa fe international corp. which is owned by kuwait and is n't related to santa fe southern pacific 's unit is stepping up development of a well off texas ' <unk> island where it found gas in N 
 we could have sat on it longer but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace says richard <unk> senior <unk> for santa fe international 
 we 're trying to get it on line as soon as possible now 
 this month exxon corp. announced plans for a <unk> project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the <unk> basin of western oklahoma the <unk> drilling project in the u.s. 
 exxon will use a parker drilling co. rig built in N that can go down N N miles 
 as the soviet union <unk> with its worsening economy leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system 
 the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika mikhail gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy 
 they lay out a clear timetable and <unk> for <unk> the system of setting prices breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business 
 they also address such <unk> subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation and recommend ways to soften the social consequences 
 while many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its <unk> and presumed <unk> <unk> 
 although it was published <unk> in the latest edition of the weekly <unk> <unk> soviet sources say the article was written by <unk> <unk> and a small group of colleagues 
 mr. <unk> head of the academy of science 's institute of economics was recently appointed deputy chairman of the soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform 
 it 's clearly a <unk> for the next stage of perestroika said one analyst 
 the economic ideas in the document are much <unk> than current policies 
 for example the proposed overhaul of prices an extremely sensitive political topic is far more precise than the vague plans announced by mr. gorbachev in N and later dropped 
 but the proposals also display political <unk> <unk> some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to <unk> powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented 
 seeking a middle path between opponents of change and <unk> who demand overnight solutions the article advocates what it calls a <unk> approach 
 the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year 
 as <unk> draw up proposals for the next five-year plan which starts in N the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform 
 the authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that quick and easy <unk> to success simply do n't exist 
 instead they <unk> out a strategy in several <unk> from now until N 
 most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest 
 the key steps <unk> include property 
 rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned 
 the document proposes breaking up the <unk> system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to <unk> helped by tough <unk> legislation 
 the economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and N including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders cooperatives and joint ventures 
 some forms of private property would be <unk> 
 such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries who now <unk> guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform 
 finances 
 emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis notably its $ N billion budget deficit 
 by the end of next year all <unk> state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives 
 similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of N 
 a unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly 
 to <unk> up some of the N billion rubles in circulation the government should encourage home ownership including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment 
 labor 
 a genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid <unk> system 
 <unk> from decades of soviet <unk> the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment 
 to cushion the <unk> the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits 
 prices 
 the entire system of <unk> set prices would be <unk> and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade 
 consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices but luxury and imported items including food would be sold at market prices 
 wholesale prices would be divided into three categories raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels <unk> procurement prices for a small number of key products and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers 
 inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer <unk> 
 foreign trade 
 the current <unk> and <unk> of foreign trade would be taken much further 
 soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad 
 foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the u.s.s.r. 
 alongside the current <unk> ruble a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western currencies 
 a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system 
 the blueprint is at its <unk> when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans the state planning committee known as <unk> and the state committee for material supply or <unk> 
 but it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies take effect

 albert engelken and robert thomson had never met though for N years their lives had been <unk> in a way <unk> to the sports world 
 mr. engelken now a <unk> executive in washington d.c. and mr. thomson a <unk> salesman in <unk> n.j. had n't even talked to each other 
 but one recent day they became much closer 
 mr. engelken a <unk> baseball fan <unk> over the sports pages to chart the <unk> of my favorite and <unk> teams and players 
 he often <unk> he says at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player 's <unk> about the <unk> millions he is offered to play the game 
 his morning paper the washington post even carries a sports column called <unk> that <unk> the latest <unk> and convictions of players and team managers 
 like many sports <unk> mr. engelken has turned <unk> 
 but his is a story about a hero in an era of sports <unk> and about what <unk> ruth mr. engelken <unk> us once called the only real game in the world 
 to mr. engelken it is also a story about love because i 'm <unk> to have a wife who still thinks her slightly <unk> husband 's <unk> birthday deserves the ultimate present 
 to understand what mr. engelken means one must go back to a <unk> october afternoon in N at new york 's <unk> grounds stadium where it can be argued the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out 
 it was the ninth inning of the third game of a <unk> <unk> between the brooklyn <unk> and the new york giants the predecessor to the san francisco giants scheduled to play in tonight 's world series 
 baseball fans throughout new york had <unk> out a long summer with their teams and now it had come to this a battle between the two for the national league <unk> down to the last inning of the last game no less 
 some N fans <unk> the stands and shouted at the top of their <unk> 
 mr. engelken was doing the same across the hudson river in new jersey where with his nose pressed against the front window of the <unk> national bank he watched the <unk> on a television set the bank set up for the event 
 the <unk> series had <unk> the <unk> giants fan 
 the giants struck first winning the <unk> N on a <unk> homer off <unk> <unk> ralph <unk> mr. engelken recalls with precision today 
 the giants got <unk> in the second game N and trailed N going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game 
 the giants scored once and had <unk> on second <unk> <unk> and third <unk> <unk> as bobby thomson advanced to the plate 
 the rest as they say is history 
 mr. thomson a tall <unk> <unk> <unk> stepped into the <unk> 's box 
 thomson took a called strike mr. engelken <unk> 
 the tension mounted as ralph <unk> again on the <unk> <unk> down the <unk> 
 he wound up and let loose a <unk> 
 the pitch <unk> toward bobby thomson high and inside and then with a crack of the bat was sent <unk> back into the lower <unk> stands 
 giants fans went into euphoria says mr. engelken 
 and bobby thomson was made a <unk> 
 the same bobby thomson it turns out who sells those <unk> today 
 there ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that bobby thomson homer who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <unk> <unk> radio broadcast the one that concluded with mr. <unk> shouting over and over the giants win the <unk> the giants win the <unk> 
 mr. engelken and mr. thomson drifted in different <unk> in the subsequent years and the <unk> grounds located under <unk> 's <unk> in upper manhattan was replaced by a <unk> project 
 mr. thomson played <unk> and third base until N posting a lifetime N <unk> average and <unk> up N home runs before retiring and going into <unk> sales 
 mr. engelken moved south to washington but he took with him <unk> memories of the homer of N 
 when his wife <unk> came down the <unk> on their <unk> day in N mr. engelken no <unk> on the romantic front gave her the ultimate <unk> you look <unk> than bobby thomson 's home run 
 the couple 's first dog homer was named after the great event though <unk> friends assumed he was the <unk> of the <unk> 
 and when mr. engelken 's sister <unk> who was born two days before the home run reached her <unk> birthday mr. engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the <unk> of events 
 mr. thomson sent off a card to <unk> it does n't seem like N years since i hit that home run to <unk> your birth it read 
 <unk> was pleased but nowhere near as much as mr. engelken 
 the family license plate reads <unk> N the first three letters of the family name and no surprise here bobby thomson 's uniform number 
 and on mr. engelken 's <unk> birthday his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to mr. thomson to be <unk> 
 what could have been better asks mr. engelken 
 <unk> engelken asked the same question earlier this year when her husband was about to turn N 
 she had an idea 
 on her husband 's <unk> birthday after an <unk> N years of marriage it should be noted <unk> al and their <unk> son set out for new york to visit <unk> university 
 mrs. engelken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor 
 the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N 
 it sounded like something out of ian fleming mr. engelken recalls 
 at the appointed exit the family pulled over and mrs. engelken went to get her papers 
 mr. engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window 
 in a matter of minutes she was back with a tall <unk> man in <unk> 
 she <unk> down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite <unk> 
 <unk> she said happy <unk> birthday 
 this is bobby thomson 
 and there he was recalls mr. engelken 
 the hero of my youth the one person in history i 'd most like to meet 
 keep your thomas <unk> or st. <unk> or <unk> i 'd take baseball 's flying <unk> without <unk> 
 they talked of the home run 
 i thought it was in the upper deck said bobby thomson now N years old 
 they talked of the aftermath 
 i never thought it would become so <unk> bobby <unk> 
 mr. engelken says his wife was <unk> by the whole thing 
 it was worth it just for the look on albert 's face 
 the two men spent an hour at exit N <unk> the event <unk> the <unk> dream of a young boy now turned N mr. engelken says 
 his hero signed photographs of the homer and <unk> called ralph <unk> a very fine <unk> 
 and when mr. engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know bobby thomson replied you know albert if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy you have an obligation to do it 
 in an interview mr. thomson who is married and has three grown children says he has few ties to baseball these days other than playing <unk> games now and again 
 but his fans to his constant <unk> never let him forget the famous <unk> 
 his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years 
 in response to the letters mr. thomson usually sends an <unk> photo with a <unk> note and rarely <unk> a <unk> 
 but when <unk> engelken wrote him saying she could stop near his new jersey home it seemed different 
 what a good feeling it would be for me to do that he says he thought 
 when the engelken family got back from its trip up north mr. engelken wrote it all down just to make sure no detail was missed 
 on the way home his notes recall it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south 
 my mind was miles north at a place called <unk> 's <unk> where a real sports hero had captured the <unk> of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it 
 take heart sports fans he wrote 
 real heroes exist 
 you might not find one in the <unk> column 
 but who knows 
 you might meet up with him at that bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N of the new jersey turnpike

 the newspaper could fetch between N million and N million canadian dollars us$ N million to $ N million said one analyst who asked not to be identified 
 a spokesman for southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses which most analysts place at between c$ N million and c$ N million 
 yesterday southam reported third-quarter earnings of c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million down from c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million in the year-ago quarter 
 to be profitable the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking said john <unk> the paper 's publisher 
 southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas 
 the acquisition of the financial times of canada is well within reach for any number of media companies both public and private said james <unk> an analyst with toronto-based <unk> james capel inc 
 possible bidders include christopher <unk> a toronto financier and vice chairman of hees international bancorp inc. a holding company controlled by toronto 's bronfman family 
 mr. <unk> sold his stake in <unk> corp. to hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition 
 mr. <unk> could n't be reached for comment but roy <unk> chairman of <unk> media a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines said his company would take a close look at the newspaper 
 mr. <unk> said the sale of the <unk> financial times which southam has owned since N is consistent with southam 's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while <unk> of <unk> <unk> assets 
 southam agreed to sell its N N stake in <unk> communications ltd. a broadcasting concern to <unk> hunter ltd. for about c$ N million last year 
 this year it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas 
 the financial times of canada has no links to the british daily newspaper the financial times 
 norton co. said net income for the third quarter fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share

 the company had a tax credit of $ N million 
 in the year-earlier quarter the tax credit was $ N million 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 operating profit in the company 's <unk> segment rose N N while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose N N 
 however the company 's petroleum services segment while profitable was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company 's buy-out of a N N stake in eastman <unk> co. from texas eastern corp. last june 
 norton and texas eastern had each held a N N stake in eastman in a joint venture 
 norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of eastman <unk> 
 for the nine months norton had net of $ N million or $ N a share and a tax credit of $ N million 
 in the year-earlier period the company had net of $ N million or $ N a share and a tax credit of $ N million

 <unk> park and her family <unk> for four years to buy a tiny apartment here but found that the closer they got to saving the $ N they originally needed the more the price rose 
 by this month it had more than doubled 
 now the <unk> <unk> whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics is saving harder than ever 
 i am determined to get an apartment in three years she says 
 it 's all i think about or talk about 
 for the parks and millions of other young koreans the <unk> dream of home ownership has become a <unk> illusion 
 for the government it has become a highly volatile political issue 
 last may a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem 
 during the past N years the report showed housing prices increased nearly <unk> 
 the report laid the blame on speculators who it said had pushed land prices up <unk> 
 the panel found that since N real-estate prices rose nearly N N in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity the N seoul olympics and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop korea 's southwest 
 the result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially 
 for those with no holdings the prospects of buying a home are ever <unk> 
 in N a quarter of the population owned N N of the nation 's N square <unk> of private land the report said and N N of the population owned N N of the land devoted to housing 
 meanwhile the government 's land bureau reports that only about a third of korean families own their own homes 
 <unk> have soared along with house prices 
 former national <unk> hong <unk> now a radio <unk> says the problem is <unk> for many people 
 i 'm afraid of a popular <unk> if this situation is n't corrected he adds 
 in fact during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the land bureau is <unk> and at the national assembly demanding the government put a stop to real-estate speculation 
 president roh <unk> woo 's administration has been studying the real-estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land <unk> 
 last week the government took three bills to the national assembly 
 the proposed legislation is aimed at <unk> some of the <unk> in the current <unk> system 
 <unk> of the bills as currently <unk> are a restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own to N square <unk> in the nation 's six largest cities but more in smaller cities and rural areas 
 the government will <unk> offenders but wo n't <unk> property 
 a tax of between N N and N N on property holdings that exceed the <unk> ceiling 
 taxes of between N N and N N a year on excessive profits from the resale of property or the sale of idle land to the government 
 the government <unk> excessive profits as those above the average realized for other <unk> properties in an area 
 grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect 
 the administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation free more land for the government 's ambitious <unk> program designed to build two million apartments by N and perhaps boost the popular standing of president roh 
 but opposition legislators and others calling for help for south korea 's <unk> say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home 
 some want lower limits on house <unk> others insist on <unk> higher taxation for larger homes and lots 
 the citizens coalition for economic justice a <unk> group leading the charge for radical reform wants restrictions on <unk> high taxation of capital gains and drastic revamping of the <unk> system on which property taxes are based 
 but others large <unk> real-estate developers and business leaders say the government 's proposals are <unk> 
 led by the federation of korean industries the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties 
 government officials who are urging real-estate reforms <unk> at the arguments of business leaders and <unk> at their pressure 
 there is no violation of the <unk> principle of private property in what we are doing says lee <unk> <unk> director of the government 's land bureau which drafted the bills 
 but he adds the constitution <unk> the government to impose some controls to <unk> the shortage of land 
 the land available for housing construction stands at about N square <unk> a person N N lower than in taiwan and only about half that of japan 
 mr. lee estimates that about N property speculators are operating in south korea 
 the chief <unk> he says are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land not for their corporate use but for resale at huge profit 
 one research institute calculated that as much as N N of <unk> land is held by N companies and that as little as N N of that is used for business 
 the government 's office of bank supervision and examination told the national assembly this month that in the first half of N the nation 's N largest business groups bought real estate valued at $ N billion 
 the ministry of finance as a result has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals 
 under those measures financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations 
 banks investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to N N of their capital currently the proportion is N N 
 the maximum <unk> property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to N N of their total asset value down from N N currently 
 but mrs. park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation apartment prices are unlikely to go down 
 at best she <unk> they will rise more slowly more slowly she hopes than her family 's income 
 <unk> corp. <unk> n.j. declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share payable dec. N to stock of record nov. N 
 the maker of specialty chemicals has about N million shares outstanding 
 the company said the move recognizes its strong financial position 
 although profits were squeezed in N mainly as a result of higher <unk> costs the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for N and beyond 
 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday <unk> shares rose N cents to close at $ N a share 
 the justice department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a pittsburgh suburb 's <unk> ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped 
 this would be the department 's first suit challenging a local <unk> ordinance under N amendments to the fair housing act 
 under those amendments which took effect in march of this year the federal government can intervene in private <unk> lawsuits 
 the ordinance in moon township prohibits <unk> a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility 
 in papers filed with the federal district court in pittsburgh the justice department alleged that the ordinance by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township makes housing unavailable on account of <unk> 
 the private suit was brought by three <unk> <unk> people who live in a group home in moon 
 <unk> smith moon township manager said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the <unk> <unk> from changing the character and flavor of the neighborhood 
 he said the ordinance also will benefit the <unk> <unk> 
 our intent is to spread them out to insure they are well integrated into the community he said 
 energetic and concrete action has been taken in colombia during the past N days against the <unk> of the drug trade but it has not been sufficiently effective because unfortunately it came too late 
 ten years ago the newspaper el espectador of which my brother <unk> was editor began warning of the rise of the drug <unk> and of their leaders ' aspirations to control colombian politics especially the congress 
 then when it would have been easier to resist them nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug <unk> three years ago 
 the most <unk> <unk> have not <unk> their press more <unk> than the drug <unk> <unk> colombia 's 
 the censorship is <unk> through terrorism and assassination 
 in the past N years about N journalists have been <unk> forever murdered 
 within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the el espectador in <unk> destroying a major part of its installations and equipment 
 and only last week the newspaper <unk> liberal in the city of <unk> was <unk> and its installations destroyed 
 journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets 
 distribution centers are <unk> and advertisers are <unk> 
 censorship is imposed by terrorism 
 if the colombian media accept this new and <unk> censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world 
 the solidarity of the <unk> media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive 
 the american people and their government also <unk> up too late to the <unk> drugs posed to the moral structure of their country 
 even now the american attack upon this tremendous problem is <unk> in <unk> to the magnitude of the threat 
 i can <unk> that a recent colombian <unk> to the u.s. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between grand central terminal and the <unk> <unk> hotel in <unk> manhattan 
 colombia alone its government its people its newspapers does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully 
 all <unk> countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs 
 the u.s. as the major drug consumer should lead this joint effort 
 reduction if not the total <unk> of drug consumption is the requirement for victory 
 much is being done in colombia to fight the drug <unk> mafia 
 <unk> homes and <unk> have been <unk> by the military authorities and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized 
 more than N planes and <unk> have been <unk> at airports and a large number of vehicles and <unk> has been confiscated 
 the military has also captured enormous <unk> of powerful and sophisticated weapons <unk> and other <unk> <unk> 
 much has been accomplished and public opinion <unk> supports the government and the army but on the other hand none of the key drug <unk> have been captured 
 there has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money 
 in my opinion this is not true 
 <unk> drug money has served only to increase <unk> the price of real estate creating serious problems for low-income people who <unk> to own their own homes 
 drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars airplanes <unk> and <unk> where drugs are consumed 
 but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside colombia 
 in fact the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle 
 what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of <unk> drug money is higher prices for colombia 's legitimate products 
 the price of coffee has gone down almost N N since the beginning of the year to the lowest level after inflation since the great depression 
 market conditions point to even lower prices next year 
 the <unk> coffee <unk> had to be formally <unk> this summer 
 as a result colombia will earn $ N million less from its coffee this year than last 
 our coffee growers face reductions in their income and this <unk> them to <unk> <unk> <unk> crops for coffee 
 u.s. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export cut flowers into the american market 
 a just price and an open market for what colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the u.s. 
 i take advantage of this opportunity given to me by the wall street journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs 
 each <unk> of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible <unk> 
 a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is <unk> 
 mr. <unk> is president of el espectador a newspaper founded by his <unk> 
 it has more drug users than boston has people 
 <unk> thousand of its children live in foster homes while N residents have no homes at all 
 its tax base is shrinking a $ N billion budget deficit looms and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year 
 this is new york city 
 when the dust and <unk> settle in an <unk> mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named david dinkins 
 running the nation 's largest and most <unk> city may be no treat but at least mr. dinkins knows what to expect from it 
 as the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him 
 after N years in city politics david dinkins remains an <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> manhattan borough president the first black man to win the democratic nomination for mayor here does n't have a single prominent political enemy 
 while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own 
 asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff 
 now as election day <unk> even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the <unk> on nov. N 
 they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political <unk> who may seek a place at the trough 
 they wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him 
 will he if he wins be in the <unk> of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have <unk> money into his campaign 
 after his decisive primary victory over mayor edward i. koch in september mr. dinkins <unk> until recently on a <unk> lead over his republican opponent rudolph giuliani the former crime <unk> who has proved a something of a <unk> as a candidate 
 but mr. dinkins has <unk> in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted <unk> and over his handling of a stock sale to his son 
 polls also have recorded some <unk> in mr. dinkins 's support among jewish voters and <unk> projections now put his lead at between four and N percentage points 
 in an interview with reporters and editors of the wall street journal mr. dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the <unk> 
 a lot of people think i will give away the store but i can assure you i will not he says 
 i am aware we have real budgetary problems 
 the city is full of aging bridges water <unk> and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair 
 renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly 
 but city officials say tax revenues are lagging 
 and after a decade of explosive job growth on wall street a period of <unk> is under way 
 mr. koch already has announced he will drop N jobs from the city payroll but that wo n't be enough 
 new york state comptroller edward <unk> predicts a $ N billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession 
 if elected mr. dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on <unk> businesses or cut spending in already <unk> neighborhoods 
 he is going to face a mess says city council president andrew stein 
 his supporters are not <unk> but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money 
 by and large mr. dinkins has <unk> the touchy question of whose <unk> he would <unk> 
 instead of focusing on the financial future mr. dinkins has sold himself as a <unk> for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a <unk> <unk> to N years of <unk> generated by mayor koch 
 the thing about the dinkins <unk> is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <unk> <unk> a real-estate executive and former aide to gov. mario <unk> 
 it is a <unk> <unk> 
 no doubt mr. dinkins has been a <unk> influence 
 he is an <unk> figure who <unk> the <unk> of colleagues ' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody 
 more important he emerged as a <unk> last summer after the central park rape of a white <unk> in which a group of <unk> <unk> was charged and the racial murder of a black <unk> in the white brooklyn neighborhood of <unk> 
 rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would mr. dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head 
 keeping cool is a dinkins priority on <unk> days this summer he was known to change his <unk> suits as many as four times a day 
 but even in his <unk> campaign he has shown signs of the <unk> and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as manhattan borough president and might <unk> him as mayor 
 over the last few weeks he has <unk> away roughly half of what was once a <unk> lead in the polls over mr. giuliani 
 a story about how he <unk> the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political <unk> <unk> sutton was allowed to <unk> a full week before mr. dinkins faced the media 
 he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely <unk> to the media until the stock story broke 
 his campaign was caught <unk> amid allegations it paid almost $ N for what it said was a <unk> effort by black activist <unk> carson a convicted <unk> who later said publicly that he is <unk> 
 critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the dinkins camp to get mr. carson to stop leading <unk> demonstrations <unk> the <unk> murder protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate 
 mr. dinkins also has failed to <unk> jewish voters ' fears about his association with the rev. <unk> jackson despite the fact that few local <unk> politicians have been as <unk> for jewish causes in the past N years as mr. dinkins has 
 these campaign problems have <unk> difficulties mr. dinkins has run into before 
 a former u.s. marine mr. dinkins got off to a quick start in politics joining a local democratic political club in the 1950s linking up with black urban leaders such as charles <unk> <unk> paterson and mr. sutton and getting himself elected to the state assembly in N 
 but his chance to become deputy mayor under mayor <unk> <unk> a plan boosted by mr. sutton was <unk> because of mr. dinkins 's failure still largely <unk> to file income tax returns for four years running 
 i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time 
 later mr. dinkins became more deeply <unk> to mr. sutton and other city <unk> including <unk> council president paul <unk> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely <unk> post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau among other things 
 mr. <unk> is now one of the lawyers for mr. sutton 's media company 
 the debt rose further in N when mr. sutton resigned his position as manhattan borough president to run for mayor 
 mr. sutton recalls when i left i sat down with charlie <unk> <unk> paterson and david and david said who will run for borough president and i said you will 
 david <unk> mayor koch 's longtime media adviser says of mr. dinkins he really is the <unk> of the <unk> system 
 but the guy is so personally decent people tend to forget that 
 mr. dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in N 
 but by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's board of estimate the body that votes on crucial budget and <unk> matters 
 colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would <unk> into the early morning hours as mr. dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en <unk> certain controversial proposals 
 he taught me how to drink <unk> tea instead of coffee at N a.m. i 'll give him that says deputy mayor robert <unk> 
 often mr. dinkins 's <unk> prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out critics claim 
 on the campaign <unk> he often points out that he was the only board of estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at manhattan 's columbus circle 
 but board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position 
 says one city official everybody else had brought in the <unk> and made their deal 
 he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster 
 one board member bronx borough president ferdinand <unk> was said to be so <unk> with mr. dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr. dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign 
 i had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind mr. <unk> admits but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of mr. dinkins and that he backs the democratic candidate <unk> 
 mr. dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff bill lynch denies that the manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues 
 we did n't <unk> everything that came to us mr. lynch says 
 on some occasions when mr. dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble 
 some supporters were stunned this summer when mr. dinkins suggested weakening the law <unk> public employees to go on strike 
 he withdrew the remark 
 when he later <unk> with striking hospital workers some allies <unk> a little more concerned that mr. dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees 
 then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups mr. dinkins promised he would issue a three-year <unk> on construction of <unk> plants 
 that announcement was <unk> criticized by mayor koch who has endorsed mr. dinkins because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ N million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under mr. dinkins 's proposal 
 while his public statements have at times been confusing mr. dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected <unk> sentiment 
 he favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city 
 in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents 
 with an <unk> local labor pool many experts believe that policy could drive businesses from the city 
 and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city 
 many <unk> officials say the koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save N chase manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson 
 but mr. dinkins 's economic <unk> do n't seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support 
 steven <unk> president of the real estate board of new york an industry organization says mr. dinkins 's economic development program is <unk> but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable 
 mr. dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both <unk> and <unk> leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential 
 the key man seems to be the campaign manager mr. lynch 
 a <unk> <unk> son of a long island potato farmer mr. lynch is a veteran union <unk> who worked on the presidential campaigns of sen. edward kennedy and mr. jackson 
 but as the dinkins campaign hit tough times this month andrew <unk> the politically <unk> son of the new york governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy 
 another close ally is ruth <unk> a manhattan city <unk> some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into mr. dinkins 's position papers 
 if she remains influential with mr. dinkins as some suggest she will his <unk> may take on a more <unk> flavor 
 but lincoln center president nathan leventhal who would head a dinkins transition team is more mainstream as is real-estate executive anthony <unk> another insider 
 mr. dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include american express co. chairman james d. robinson iii investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist <unk> lewis and attorney joseph flom 
 some business leaders and others also believe that mr. dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background 
 names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate richard <unk> former schools chancellor frank <unk> and messrs. leventhal and <unk> 
 then there are mr. dinkins 's <unk> <unk> colleagues such as u.s. rep. <unk> former deputy mayor paterson and mr. sutton 
 having <unk> positions of real influence or wealth these men constitute the old guard of new york city black politics they are less <unk> than the younger more activist black political community that has been based largely in brooklyn 
 part of mr. dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the brooklyn and <unk> <unk> 
 we know there are <unk> for the city out there says mr. paterson mr. dinkins 's former law partner 
 if any of us think we 're going to <unk> david 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us we are making a sad mistake 
 adds ms. <unk> who is expected to win the borough president 's job mr. dinkins is <unk> you have to remember david is a <unk> 
 but mr. dinkins 's sense of <unk> often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple <unk> 
 he is taken <unk> in an interview when asked whether as mayor he plans on <unk> the political <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of new york 's school system 
 i will sit down and talk some of the problems out but take on the political system <unk> he says with a shake of the head 
 despite many doubts about his <unk> white new <unk> who gave mr. dinkins N N of their votes in the primary are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to mr. giuliani 
 the former u.s. attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from mafia <unk> to wall street executives has succeeded in raising questions about mr. dinkins 's ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own <unk> 
 as a republican in an <unk> democratic city mr. giuliani has an inherent <unk> 
 as a first-time candidate he has been slow to learn the <unk> of new york city <unk> 
 mr. giuliani is finding that mr. dinkins in his many years in public life has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to <unk> certain <unk> 
 the bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy says malcolm <unk> a jewish community leader 
 in the end i think david will be <unk> for being david 
 <unk> johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a <unk> <unk> home 
 a deep <unk> now runs along its north wall exposed when the house <unk> two feet off its foundation during last week 's earthquake

 the <unk> <unk> ms. johnson dressed in jeans and a <unk> as she <unk> through the steady afternoon rain is a claims adjuster with aetna life & casualty 
 she has been on the move almost <unk> since last thursday when an army of adjusters employed by major insurers <unk> the san francisco area to help policyholders <unk> through the rubble and restore some order to their lives 
 equipped with cellular telephones laptop computers <unk> and a pack of blank checks they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters buy food replace lost clothing repair broken water <unk> and <unk> walls 
 some of the funds will used to <unk> unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction 
 many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ N on the spot 
 they do n't <unk> at writing them 
 that 's my job get policyholders what they 're entitled to says bill schaeffer a claims supervisor who flew in from aetna 's <unk> conn. office 
 the <unk> house that ms. johnson is <unk> has been deemed <unk> by town officials 
 but she asks a <unk> <unk> the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open <unk> window 
 once inside she spends nearly four hours measuring and <unk> each room in the <unk> house gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it 
 she <unk> photos of the <unk> floors and the <unk> that has fallen away from the walls 
 while she works inside a <unk> returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing

 only about N N of california home and business owners carried earthquake coverage 
 the <unk> ' own home also in los <unk> suffered <unk> minor damage 
 ms. johnson who works out of aetna 's office in <unk> creek an east bay suburb is <unk> by the earthquake 's <unk> force

 if you do n't you ca n't do your job 
 for aetna and other insurers the san francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched 
 most companies still are trying to sort through the <unk> caused by hurricane hugo in the carolinas last month 
 aetna which has nearly N adjusters had deployed about N of them in charlotte columbia and charleston 
 adjusters who had been working on the east coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through december 
 it could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims 
 when the earthquake rocked northern california last week aetna senior claims executives from the san francisco area were at the company 's hartford conn. headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes including earthquakes 
 since commercial airline flights were disrupted the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the west coast and bring along portable computers cellular phones and some claims adjusters 
 because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country 
 even so few had ever dealt with an earthquake 
 some adjusters like alan singer of san diego had been working in charleston for nearly four weeks 
 he returned home last thursday packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty friday in <unk> creek 
 offices were set up in san francisco and san jose 
 in a few <unk> aetna knew it would probably be <unk> out big <unk> even before a client called or <unk> in a claim 
 for example officials at <unk> creek office learned that the <unk> hotel near the san francisco airport which is insured by aetna was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news 
 the secret to being a good adjuster is counting says <unk> <unk> an aetna adjuster from santa ana 
 you have to count everything 
 adjusters must count the number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 but they must also <unk> a price to each of these items as well as to floors <unk> <unk> and <unk> to come up with a total value for a house 
 to do that they must think in terms of <unk> by the square foot carpeting by the square yard <unk> by the roll <unk> by the linear foot 
 using a <unk> and a <unk> guide for such jobs as painting plumbing and <unk> in each major region of the country adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it 
 sometimes repairs are out of the question 
 when aetna adjuster bill schaeffer visited a retired couple in oakland last thursday he found them living in a mobile home <unk> in front of their yard 
 the house itself located about N yards from the collapsed section of <unk> highway interstate N was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its <unk> 
 the next day mr. schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $ N to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood 
 he also is working with a real-estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built 
 many of the adjusters employed by aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or <unk> 
 but such skills were <unk> to <unk> johnson 
 four years ago she was managing a <unk> shop and was totally <unk> 
 a friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at aetna if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her 
 she signed up starting as an inside adjuster who <unk> minor claims and does a lot of work by phone 
 a year later she moved to the commercial property claims division 
 she spent a month at an aetna school in <unk> pa. learning all about the construction trade including <unk> plumbing and electrical <unk> 
 that was followed by three months at the aetna institute in hartford where she was <unk> in learning how to read and interpret policies 
 her new line of work has some <unk> 
 recently a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old <unk> house <unk> by an <unk> 
 i owe that contractor 
 i really do she says 
 as ms. johnson stands outside the hammack house after <unk> up her chores there the house begins to <unk> and <unk> 
 the ground <unk> <unk> her 
 it is an <unk> one of about N since the earthquake and it makes her uneasy 
 the next day as she prepares a $ N check for the <unk> which will cover the cost of <unk> the house and clearing away the debris she <unk> at the <unk> noise 
 on further reflection she admits that <unk> inside the <unk> ' house the previous day was n't such a great idea 
 during her second meeting with the <unk> ms. johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers 
 they would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside 
 ms. johnson tells them that if the appliances ca n't be <unk> their policy covers the replacement cost 
 mr. hammack is eager to know what aetna will pay for the house which has to come down 
 when will i get that check for a million dollars he jokes 
 the adjuster had n't completed all the calculations but says we 're talking policy limits 
 in this case that 's about $ N 
 it suddenly <unk> on mr. hammack that rebuilding the house in los <unk> an affluent community in santa clara county may cost more than aetna 's policy will pay 
 we can lose money on this he says 
 and you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance says mrs. hammack reaching across the table and gently <unk> his hand 
 earthquake insurance costs about $ N to $ N annually for every $ N of value and high <unk> mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe 
 so many californians believe they can get by without it 
 even ms. johnson herself made that assumption 
 i always knew that the big one was coming but not during my lifetime she says 
 now she says she 's thinking of <unk> her own insurance agent 
 for ms. johnson dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience 
 she lives in oakland a community hit hard by the earthquake 
 she did n't have hot water for five days 
 the apartment she shares with a <unk> daughter and her sister was rattled books and crystal hit the floor but nothing was severely damaged 
 her sister cynthia wishes <unk> had a different job 
 we worry about her out there cynthia says 
 last sunday ms. johnson finally got a chance to water her plants but stopped abruptly 
 i realized i could n't waste this water when there are people in <unk> who do n't have fresh water to drink 
 she has n't played any music since the earthquake hit out of respect for those who died on interstate N where the roadway collapsed 
 the federal communications commission allowed american telephone & telegraph co. to continue offering discount phone services for <unk> customers and said it would soon <unk> its regulation of the long-distance market 
 the fcc moves were good news for at&t which has been <unk> since the breakup of the phone system for greater <unk> in pricing and reduced regulation 
 alfred <unk> the new fcc chairman <unk> deregulation of at&t at his last job as head of a commerce department telecommunications agency 
 but it has been an open question whether mr. <unk> an extraordinarily cautious man would continue pushing deregulation at the fcc in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure 
 it means that <unk> is serious about the deregulation of long distance said jack <unk> a telecommunications analyst at painewebber inc. who attended the fcc meeting 
 all the commissioners were in amazing agreement to <unk> regulation for only having been together for a few months 
 the fcc took three specific actions regarding at&t 
 by a N vote it allowed at&t to continue offering special discount packages to big customers called tariff N rejecting appeals by at&t competitors that the discounts were illegal 
 then by a separate N vote it chose the <unk> possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan called tariff N that at&t offered to holiday corp 
 at&t gave a N N to N N discount to the memphis tenn. company that oversees holiday <unk> in response to a similar discount offered to holiday corp. by mci communications corp 
 the agency said that because mci 's offer had expired at&t could n't continue to offer its discount plan 
 but the agency specifically did n't rule whether at&t had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users 
 indeed joe <unk> at&t 's vice president for <unk> services said at&t offered a similar tariff N discount to resort <unk> international of indianapolis to meet another mci bid 
 the fcc did n't say i could n't do it again he said 
 apart from those two actions mr. <unk> and the three other commissioners said they expect to <unk> how at&t is regulated since competition has increased 
 richard <unk> chief of the fcc 's <unk> bureau said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year 
 at&t <unk> the fcc 's actions 
 the time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it the new york telecommunications firm said in a statement 
 but mci of washington was <unk> with the fcc decision concerning tariff N arguing that at&t can not be allowed to <unk> fcc rules 
 united telecommunications inc. 's us <unk> unit said it was obviously disappointed with the fcc decision on tariff N 
 us <unk> said was it will petition the fcc decision in federal court 
 we believe that the court will find it unlawful said a us <unk> spokesman 
 separately at&t filed a <unk> against mci <unk> it of misleading consumers through allegedly false and deceptive advertising 
 the at&t action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight 
 earlier this month mci sued at&t in federal district court claiming that at&t 's ads are false 
 at&t assembled three of its top executives in washington all <unk> angry to try to <unk> mci 's charges 
 mci has made <unk> out of the upper <unk> of at&t said painewebber 's mr. <unk> who said he expected at&t to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime <unk>

 billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds <unk> a <unk> of support in the already reeling junk market 
 last week alone an <unk> $ N billion <unk> out of the junk funds or nearly N N of their total assets according to estimates by <unk> financial services inc. a boston research firm 
 in the past two months the nation 's N junk funds have lost a total of about $ N billion more than N N of assets through sales or transfers of <unk> shares <unk> says 
 it made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds 
 interviews with three major fund groups fidelity investments vanguard group inc. and t. rowe price associates inc. confirm the trend 
 their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ N million or about N N of their junk fund assets in the past two months 
 some fund managers say negative publicity has <unk> investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices 
 people have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying i ca n't take it anymore i 'm getting out says kurt brouwer of brouwer & <unk> a san francisco investment adviser 
 the withdrawals could <unk> trouble for the $ N billion junk market 
 if the heavy outflows continue fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay <unk> investors in the weeks ahead 
 such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems 
 mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the <unk> money says louis <unk> <unk> 's president 
 mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts and to a lesser extent <unk> funds 
 so the impact on the $ N billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight 
 but tremors are likely in the junk-bond market which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years 
 mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield high-risk market 
 the N mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ N billion 
 other funds hold a <unk> of junk bonds too 
 the $ N billion fidelity high income fund has had a net <unk> of about $ N million in the past two months 
 about $ N million <unk> out last week alone double the level of the week following last month 's campeau corp. credit squeeze 
 about N N of the <unk> was transferred to other fidelity funds says neal <unk> a fidelity vice president marketing with most going into money market funds 
 you get a news item it hits you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following then go back to normal says mr. <unk> 
 the fund with a cash cushion of more than N N has met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing mr. <unk> says 
 he adds our fund has had positive net sales every month for the last three years until this month 
 vanguard 's $ N billion high yield bond portfolio has seen $ N million flow out since early september $ N million of that <unk> out friday oct. N alone 
 still two-thirds of the <unk> has been <unk> into other vanguard portfolios says brian <unk> a vice president 
 the fund now holds a cash position of about N N 
 at the $ N million t. rowe price high yield fund investors <unk> out about $ N million in the past two months 
 those withdrawals most of which were transferred to other t. rowe price funds followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through august 
 the last two months have been the whole ball game says steven <unk> a vice president 
 <unk> holders have barely broken even this year as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices 
 through oct. N high-yield funds had an average N N total return the price change plus dividends on fund shares according to lipper analytical services inc 
 that 's even less than the N N total return of the merrill lynch high-yield index 
 fidelity 's junk fund has fallen N N this year through oct. N lipper says the vanguard fund rose N N and the t. rowe price fund edged up N N 
 people who remain in junk funds now could get hit again some analysts and fund specialists say 
 many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their <unk> junk issues such as rjr nabisco to raise cash to meet expected redemptions 
 funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of <unk> borrowers 
 and then asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far 
 says michael <unk> chief investment officer of republic national bank and manager of the <unk> group in new york it 's a time bomb just waiting to go off 
 the surprise resignation yesterday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the british economy 
 the u.s. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble as market participants switched out of pounds 
 the pound also dropped <unk> against the mark falling below the key <unk> level to N marks from N marks late wednesday 
 mr. lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent <unk> speculation of a <unk> between the chancellor and prime minister margaret thatcher 
 indeed only hours earlier mrs. thatcher had called mr. lawson 's economic policies sound and said she has always supported him 
 there was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst said patrick foley deputy chief economic adviser for <unk> bank in london 
 the resignation came as a great surprise 
 graham <unk> manager of foreign-exchange operations at hong kong & shanghai banking corp. in new york added that mrs. thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline 
 the market was caught totally the wrong way 
 everyone was extremely long on sterling mr. <unk> said 
 in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks up from N marks late wednesday and at N yen up from N yen late wednesday 
 sterling was quoted at $ N sharply down from $ N late wednesday 
 in tokyo friday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen up from thursday 's tokyo close of N yen 
 few analysts had much good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in mrs. thatcher 's economic policies 
 mr. foley of <unk> noted that mr. lawson 's replacement john major the british foreign minister will take time to establish his credibility and in the meantime sterling could trend downward in volatile trade 
 but mr. foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead commenting that mr. major shares a very similar view of the world with mr. lawson 
 bob <unk> chief economist at <unk> bank in new york also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered united kingdom economic policies 
 unless mr. lawson 's resignation leads to a change in british interest-rate policy mrs. thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check or <unk> toward full <unk> in the european monetary system 's exchange-rate mechanism mr. lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates mr. <unk> concluded 
 also announcing his resignation thursday was alan walters mrs. thatcher 's economic adviser and mr. lawson 's <unk> 
 the pound which had been trading at about $ N in new york prior to mr. lawson 's announcement sank more than two cents to $ N prompting the federal reserve bank to buy pounds for dollars 
 the fed 's move however only proved a <unk> to the pound 's slide and the fed intervened for a second time at around $ N according to new york traders 
 meanwhile dollar trading was relatively <unk> throughout the session according to dealers who noted that thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross national product was something of a <unk> 
 u.s. gnp rose at an annual rate of N N in the third quarter 
 the implicit price deflator a measure of inflation was down to a N N annual rate of increase in the quarter from a N N rate of gain in the second quarter 
 in europe the dollar ended lower in <unk> trading 
 the market closed prior to mr. lawson 's announcement 
 on the commodity exchange in new york gold for current delivery rose $ N to $ N an ounce in heavy trading 
 the close was the highest since august N 
 estimated volume was five million ounces 
 in early trading in hong kong friday gold was quoted at $ N an ounce 
 the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission

 on an office wall of the senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from chairman david boren do n't hold your ticket <unk> the show 's over 
 he once used that line in a <unk> meeting on panama meaning do n't shrink from taking action against manuel noriega 
 so how did a good senator like this end up <unk> a policy that required the u.s. to warn mr. noriega of any coup plot against him 
 i agree it 's ridiculous says mr. boren and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the u.s. decides to take or rather not to take covert action 
 george bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to gop senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the panama <unk> to congress 
 but the broader truth is more complicated and <unk> 
 the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council 
 staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the u.s. could not do to oust the panamanian <unk> 
 they simply got carried away with <unk> what the executive order banning assassinations really meant 
 mr. boren himself did n't discover the <unk> <unk> until mr. bush told him privately at the white house last week 
 it 's ironic that david boren should be in the center of this <unk> 
 a former oklahoma governor he 's a <unk> <unk> of presidential powers in foreign policy 
 he 's a rare democratic <unk> 
 he 's the senator most like arthur <unk> the gop senator from michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> are heroes of mine mr. boren says referring as well to sam <unk> the democratic house speaker who <unk> with president <unk> 
 they allowed this country to be credible 
 i really want to see that happen again 
 if this were N mr. boren might even succeed 
 but in N most senators have other ideas 
 last july his committee rejected a reagan administration plan to support a coup in panama 
 ohio democrat howard <unk> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a <unk> notion for a great power 
 maine republican william cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban 
 so the administration dropped it 
 by october when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing little should be done 
 mr. boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that congress has made mistakes 
 in the aftermath of vietnam in the aftermath of iran-contra i can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says 
 but even mr. boren <unk> congressional oversight 
 writing in the harvard international review he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a consensus 
 so what does consensus mean 
 it does n't mean <unk> he insists though he implies it means a bipartisan majority 
 the <unk> of u.s. foreign policy is essential he explains 
 why was <unk> so successful 
 because it had bipartisan support 
 mr. boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions 
 elliott abrams a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <unk> or the <unk> <unk> would have taken place if consensus had been required 
 <unk> and <unk> were <unk> enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators mr. boren notwithstanding are less modest 
 the result is that the senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action 
 i would n't say it 's quite a veto mr. boren <unk> 
 but would n't a president who acted despite senate objections be taking grave political risks 
 he would agrees the chairman 
 but that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead 
 mr. boren even <unk> a silver <unk> 
 he figures the episode will help clarify any <unk> between the committee and administration 
 he points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from president bush saying that they do n't disagree 
 more broadly mr. boren hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power 
 maybe this will jolt us out of the <unk> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says 
 maybe if every senator shared the principles of mr. boren 
 but it 's just as <unk> to argue that if even david boren can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation 
 maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an exchange of letters that insists on running foreign policy by committee that <unk> a president as just another guy at the table 
 the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power 
 but panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock 
 the lawyers are now in charge of our national security 
 in panama the u.s. interests at stake were <unk> minor the only people killed were foreigners <unk> enough to trust american will 
 americans may not be so lucky the next time 
 i was impressed by the <unk> of your sept. N story rural enterprise tough row to <unk> 
 we lived in rural areas many years but now live in st. louis county <unk> 
 this morning as i drove the N miles to my law office and <unk> the routine heavy traffic during that <unk> <unk> i thought of how <unk> it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening 
 the presence of so many people cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live 
 i thought back to our time in small <unk> <unk> communities 
 i remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by <unk> <unk> residents and what <unk> <unk> an original <unk> in <unk> that were long accustomed to <unk> safe ways of thought and action 
 i remembered being fired at age N with five children at home when my views and actions were deemed <unk> by a <unk> small-town employer 
 how difficult it is for a thinking person to live among <unk> rooted in the past 
 now i <unk> in the freedom culture activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic <unk> and perpetual <unk> projects 
 yet when my youngest child died two years ago i buried him in the church cemetery of a small missouri town 
 so after all even the <unk> critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing <unk> for those scarce rural <unk> thought to exist amid fields <unk> and country <unk>

 finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of waertsilae marine oy a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be <unk> 
 at stake are almost N jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of finland 's <unk> economic revival 
 shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish <unk> remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over europe 
 but if as many now fear waertsilae marine joins the ranks of failed <unk> it might turn out to be remembered most as a <unk> on finland 's international reputation 
 the shipyard 's N billion finnish <unk> $ N billion backlog includes about N ships ordered by big international shippers including three for carnival cruise lines inc 
 miami-based carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean 
 the second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N 
 one analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule but that carnival may have to pay up to N N more to get the second and third ships 
 all the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built 
 bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments shippers will counter with a <unk> of lawsuits 
 state loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy 
 however some bankers cited possible parallels between the waertsilae marine case and the collapse of norway 's state-owned <unk> <unk> as two years ago 
 in that case international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees 
 doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts warn 
 moreover state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers say 
 the decision by a majority of <unk> waertsilae marine directors monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt <unk> from previous government policy 
 in august the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard 
 at the time <unk> by oy waertsilae a conglomerate the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion <unk> and was on the brink of liquidation 
 under the rescue plan waertsilae sold N N of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds 
 the government in turn guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board 
 government officials were expected to combine waertsilae marine with two other struggling firms and thus ensure finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation 
 the government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was <unk> when the parent waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute 
 after the restructuring of waertsilae marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees two big bank creditors union bank of finland and state-controlled <unk> resumed lending the shipyard working capital 
 but the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been <unk> about the shipyard 's actual financial condition and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn 
 people familiar with monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to <unk> <unk> the credit guarantees that led union bank and <unk> to halt lending to waertsilae marine 
 then in a <unk> <unk> <unk> directors voted to file for bankruptcy apparently under instructions from finland 's industry minister <unk> <unk> 
 analysts say mr. <unk> had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as waertsilae marine 's losses <unk> to more than double the figure estimated in august 
 noting that sweden wound up <unk> state subsidies of about N billion swedish kronor $ N billion during the 1970s in a <unk> attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry one analyst suggested that mr. <unk> may have decided to cut finland 's losses once and for all 
 senior ministry officials <unk> with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep waertsilae marine operating 
 the talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced people familiar with them said 
 one solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider 
 but there appear to be few if any suitors 
 indeed the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change <unk> and agree to pick up the bill analysts said 
 meantime shippers with vessels on order from waertsilae marine will remain in limbo 
 turner broadcasting system inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $ N million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt 
 the cable <unk> said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties and <unk> issue discount and costs related to its <unk> $ N billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries 
 a turner spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on the quarter 's earnings but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for N 
 the company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt and the outstanding class a cumulative <unk> preferred stock of cable news network was made possible by an offering of about $ N million of debentures and notes and $ N million in bank borrowings 
 the offering included $ N million of N N senior subordinated debentures due N and $ N million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due N 
 the notes were priced to yield N N and are convertible into the company 's class b common stock at a price which represents a N N premium over the market price on oct. N N 
 in addition the company called its N N N senior subordinated notes due N with an <unk> principal amount of $ N million for redemption on dec. N 
 as a result of the refinancing the company said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than N N from slightly more than N N

 the industry which currently employs about N people in london has shed about N jobs over the past two years 
 i can see cuts of at least N N more says the head of the london office of a major u.s. firm 
 the mergers and acquisitions market has been a saving grace for the industry but uncertainties are beginning to mount even there 
 <unk> takeovers are expected to continue at their brisk pace 
 but investment bankers say that stock market uncertainties in the u.s. may cause many european companies to mark time before bidding for american companies in the hope that share prices will come down 
 if prices in the states go down industrial buyers in europe have the opportunity of getting reasonable prices in the u.s. says <unk> von <unk> chief of <unk> <unk> at credit suisse first boston ltd 
 but he adds everybody and his sister have opened up <unk> shops 
 it 's difficult to see that there 's going to be enough business to go around 
 about eight firms will get the lion 's share 
 at the others there are going to be a lot of disappointments after all those promises and all that big money that 's been paid to people 
 it all adds up to a cold winter here 
 says allen d. wheat head of trading at bankers trust co. people are just plain scared 
 one person who is past worrying about london 's blues is christopher <unk> 
 last summer he <unk> his 10-year career as a london <unk> and headed for the <unk> 
 he did n't stop until he got to jackson hole <unk> 
 i 'm glad to be out said the <unk> mr. <unk> in a phone interview 
 the percentage of your day spent <unk> your <unk> got greater and the work day kept getting longer 
 what am i doing in jackson hole 
 not a great deal 
 my wife and i will stay through the skiing season or until the money runs out whichever comes first 
 but unlike london out here i 've never heard anybody blow a car horn in anger 
 <unk> australia ltd. under pressure from bank lenders has called in accounting firm peat <unk> <unk> to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company 
 analysts said the move could <unk> even <unk> action by the banks 
 but any move by the banks to take over qintex australia 's management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under australian broadcast license rules 
 that in turn could substantially reduce the value of the television assets 
 the appointment of peat <unk> which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies came about as a result of a round of meetings held by qintex australia chairman christopher skase with bank creditors 
 yesterday mr. skase said the company is <unk> and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments 
 qintex australia is a unit of qintex ltd 
 the qintex group 's problems began in <unk> in march when mr. skase agreed to buy mgm\/ua communications co 
 but the transaction faltered in september when qintex australia was forced to increase its offer to us$ N billion following a <unk> from rupert murdoch the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month 
 qintex australia owes creditors around a$ N billion 
 last friday qintex entertainment inc. its <unk> u.s. tv production and distribution affiliate filed for chapter N protection 
 the government is <unk> its newest weapon against white-collar defendants the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills 
 and defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid 
 the issue has come to a <unk> in newark n.j. where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted the government may move to seize the money that mr. antar is using to pay legal fees 
 the warning by the u.s. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the u.s. supreme court last june 
 in those cases the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment 
 if the government succeeds in <unk> mr. antar 's assets he could be left without <unk> legal representation because his attorneys are likely to quit according to individuals familiar with the case 
 a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs 
 the people who suffer in the short run are defendants but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the bill of rights says gerald <unk> a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures 
 mr. antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges 
 under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law or rico the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial 
 according to individuals familiar with mr. antar 's case prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of mr. antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure 
 in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar 's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized 
 prosecutors have told mr. antar 's attorneys that they believe mr. antar 's allegedly <unk> gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys <unk> from illegal activities 
 therefore they said the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid 
 justin <unk> and jack <unk> attorneys for mr. antar both declined to comment on the matter 
 in newark u.s. attorney samuel a. <unk> said i do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases 
 mr. <unk> said his office just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees and that is different from actually doing it although we reserve that right 
 mr. antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission 
 in that suit the sec accused mr. antar of engaging in a massive financial fraud to <unk> the earnings of crazy eddie edison n.j. over a three-year period 
 through his lawyers mr. antar has denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against mr. antar and others 
 the sec has alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits 
 mr. antar the sec said made more than $ N million from the sale of his shares between N and N 
 the justice department has emphasized that the government 's <unk> power is to be used <unk> 
 according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made 
 still criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees 
 they also worry that if the government applies <unk> laws broadly the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid 
 the stock market correction of oct. N N was a grim reminder of the oct. N N market collapse 
 since like earthquakes stock market <unk> will always be with us it is prudent to take all possible <unk> against another such market collapse 
 in general markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances 
 but there are times when they seize up and <unk> sellers can not find buyers 
 that 's just what happened in the october N crash 
 as the market tumbled <unk> market conditions prevailed the margins between buying bids and selling bids widened trading in many stocks was suspended orders took <unk> long to be executed and many specialists stopped trading altogether 
 these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages uncertainty <unk> an extra risk premium and <unk> triggered additional selling pressures 
 the situation was like that of a <unk> who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected <unk> on the <unk> 
 his <unk> spread <unk> and <unk> apart just as <unk> spreads widen during a financial panic and soon he is out of control 
 unable to stop his accelerating <unk> he crashes 
 after the N crash and as a result of the recommendations of many studies circuit breakers were devised to allow market participants to <unk> and restore orderly market conditions 
 it 's doubtful though whether circuit breakers do any real good 
 in the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone 
 instead an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market the federal reserve 
 the availability of timely assistance of a <unk> can help markets retain their resilience 
 the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent <unk> conditions in foreign-exchange markets 
 the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities 
 the stock market is the only major market without a <unk> of <unk> liquidity or a buyer of last resort 
 this does not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market 
 in N it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window 
 it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses 
 they in turn lent money to their customers who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares 
 the fed also has the power to set margin requirements 
 but would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly 
 instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity and thereby increasing the danger of inflation the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market thus stabilizing the market as a whole 
 the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle 
 the foreign-exchange and government securities markets are <unk> larger 
 daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $ N billion 
 the daily volume for treasury securities is about $ N billion 
 the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $ N billion and $ N billion 
 the $ N billion the fed <unk> into the money markets after the N crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day 
 more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action 
 and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply such as happened in october N 
 the fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious 
 it should seek only to maintain the <unk> of markets not to <unk> up the dow jones or new york stock exchange averages at a particular level 
 the fed should guard against <unk> risk but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks 
 it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell ibm or general motors shares 
 instead the fed could buy the broad market <unk> in the futures market 
 the increased demand would <unk> trading and stabilize prices 
 stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market 
 the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the <unk> the liquidity of the banks 
 <unk> market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s 
 but since the member countries of the international monetary fund agreed to the guidelines to floating in N such difficulties have been avoided 
 i can not recall any <unk> in currency markets since the N guidelines were adopted 
 thus the mere existence of a <unk> agency helps to avoid panic in <unk> 
 the old saying advises if it ai n't broke do n't fix it 
 but this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed 
 mr. heller now at visa international was a governor of the federal reserve board from N until earlier this year 
 this is adapted from a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco 
 bank of england governor robin <unk> urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs 
 caution should be the rule of the day said mr. <unk> in a speech to the association of corporate <unk> ' annual dinner 
 it would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general to say nothing of banks if <unk> does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions 
 his remarks were distributed to the press before chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced his resignation last evening 
 bank of england officials said the central bank had no comment on mr. lawson 's resignation 
 mr. <unk> reiterated that the exposure of united kingdom banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached worrying levels 
 however in light of the risks involved in such transactions banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions he said 
 in other comments he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of <unk> a change of corporate direction or strategy 
 a similar result could sometimes be achieved at less cost by changing <unk> he said 
 intel corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts but the bugs are n't expected to hurt intel and most computer makers 
 computer experts familiar with the flaws found in intel 's N chip say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their brains appear on the market sometime next year 
 intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its N microprocessor chip 's <unk> unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations 
 on friday intel began <unk> customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some <unk> calculations 
 but while international business machines corp. and compaq computer corp. say the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them 
 bugs like this are just a normal part of product development said richard <unk> director of hewlett-packard co. 's advanced systems development 
 <unk> announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the N chip early next year 
 these bugs do n't affect our schedule at all he said 
 likewise <unk> research inc. and sun microsystems inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of <unk> machines 
 we have n't modified our schedules in any way said a sun spokesman 
 to switch to another vendor 's chips would definitely not be an option he said 
 nonetheless concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of N cents in intel 's stock to $ N a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading on volume of N shares and partly responsible for a drop in compaq 's stock in new york stock exchange composite trading on wednesday 
 yesterday compaq plunged further closing at $ N a share off $ N a share on volume of N shares 
 most of compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations 
 intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing <unk> chips next week 
 we should not be seeing any more said bill rash intel 's director for the N chip 
 what 's more the bugs only emerge on <unk> applications such as <unk> design and scientific calculations he said and then very seldom 
 these <unk> do not affect business programs he said 
 the bugs will cause problems in specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications such as <unk> and <unk> said michael <unk> editor of the microprocessor report an industry newsletter 
 sun hewlett-packard and others say intel is n't wholly to blame for the <unk> 
 the real <unk> they said are computer makers such as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil <unk> products 
 the reason this is getting so much <unk> is that some started shipping and announced early availability said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 
 you can do that but you 're taking a risk 
 those companies are paying the price for taking the risk 
 in late september ibm began shipping a <unk> card that <unk> its <unk> model <unk> from a N machine to an N machine 
 an ibm spokeswoman said the company told customers monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product 
 ibm has no plans to recall its <unk> cards the spokeswoman said and could probably <unk> the bugs without long product delays 
 we do n't look at this as a major problem for us she said 
 compaq which said it discovered the bugs still plans to announce new N products on nov. N 
 because of the <unk> however the company said it does n't know when its machine will be <unk> available 
 that 's a break from compaq tradition because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers 
 the problem is being <unk> experts say because the N is intel 's future flagship 
 intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the N microprocessor is the <unk> of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines 
 although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon the N is an extremely <unk> product said mr. <unk> the newsletter editor 
 intel 's N chip is the <unk> of intel 's microprocessors a <unk> <unk> chip that only the most <unk> computer users are likely to buy for at least several years 
 unveiled last april the chip <unk> N million <unk> on a <unk> of silicon more than four times as many as on intel 's earlier model N 
 intel <unk> the chip 's speed at N million instructions per second or mips 
 that 's four times as fast as the N 
 machines using the N are expected to challenge <unk> work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called <unk> which <unk> groups of computers together and in <unk> design 
 but while the chip 's speed in processing power is <unk> it 's real strength lies in its software <unk> 
 the N is the <unk> of a long series of intel chips that began <unk> the market ever since ibm picked the <unk> N chip for its first personal computer 
 a <unk> microprocessor processes N pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer <unk> chips 
 since then intel has <unk> a large part of the market with <unk> generations of <unk> and <unk> chips all of which can run software written for previous models 
 that 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the <unk> of bugs 
 big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing <unk> machines which are expected to reach the market early next year 
 of the big computer makers only apple computer co. bases its machines on motorola chips instead 
 the N is going to have a big impact on the industry said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 
 it 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years 
 this <unk> is not going to have any affect on that at all

 bethlehem steel corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's second-largest steelmaker <unk> of france to modernize a portion of bethlehem 's ailing <unk> division 
 the venture which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make <unk> mill rolls is part of a <unk> effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years 
 the other element includes consolidating <unk> 's <unk> operations 
 the entire division employs about N workers 
 while the joint venture affects only a small part of bethlehem 's operations it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's no. N steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner 
 wall street analysts have criticized bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones 
 we think it 's a step in the right direction for bethlehem said <unk> <unk> <unk> group 's international steel analyst 
 it 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked 
 he said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies one that could open up new markets for bethlehem 
 bethlehem had little choice but to go with a european steelmaker because its competitors already have tapped the japanese and south korean industry leaders analysts noted 
 under terms of the agreement <unk> 's <unk> unit and bethlehem would establish a <unk> facility to make <unk> mill rolls at the company 's <unk> shop here 
 terms for the venture which would be jointly owned by both companies were n't disclosed 
 the <unk> unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin <unk> by early next fall 
 the <unk> improves the <unk> quality of the iron mill rolls which are basically huge rolling <unk> used to <unk> or shape steel products 
 bethlehem is also working with the united steelworkers union to consolidate <unk> 's two machine shops and four <unk> facilities of the <unk> operations 
 once the consolidation is complete bethlehem plans to concentrate its <unk> business on nuclear fabrication <unk> steel and <unk> steel rolls for rolling mills and selected <unk> applications 
 bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the <unk> division to improve its cost structure 
 in the second quarter bethlehem posted a $ N million charge related to its plans to <unk> the division 
 if you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market consider the case of columbia savings & loan 
 the california thrift has just announced a $ N million third-quarter loss 
 how did this happen 
 well when congress in its recent s&l bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by N it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made 
 but there is a <unk> ironic twist to the columbia loss 
 as <unk> of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know there is much talk in congress and indeed all over washington about the need to encourage long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed <unk> with the short term 
 now we regard this as a largely phony issue but the long term is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <unk> 
 it turns out that columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new <unk> mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its <unk> junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value 
 they could no longer be classified as what columbia regarded them namely long-term investments 
 congress 's <unk> treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings <unk> us of a story in the journal earlier this year about the baby bell companies ' desire to have the <unk> bans lifted on offering information services 
 the issue of seeking relief from congress was raised to <unk> <unk> the chairman of nynex 
 mr. <unk> replied legislation tends to be <unk> 
 i believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court through justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies 
 i see congress as a last resort 
 healthy thrifts such as columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky 
 the reality of life in modern america is that if you want to <unk> something that works let it fall into the hands of congress 
 exxon corp. said it will move its headquarters from manhattan to dallas 
 most of the N employees at the oil company 's <unk> headquarters building including much of senior management were <unk> of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by chairman lawrence g. <unk> 
 the shift wo n't affect operations 
 as part of its restructuring several years ago exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its <unk> rockefeller center <unk> to a japanese company 
 but the pullout is an embarrassment to new york city officials coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies 
 mobil corp. is in the process of <unk> its headquarters here and huge operations like j.c. penney & co. and trans world airlines have recently left 
 new york authorities informed yesterday about the move reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it 
 we are <unk> but there 's nothing we can do about it now said stanley <unk> new york city deputy mayor for finance and economic development 
 meanwhile dallas welcomed the move 
 city officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name <unk> 
 when we were told it was exxon it was beyond all expectations what a coup said tom lewis senior vice president of dallas partnership the economic development affiliate of the city 's chamber of commerce 
 dallas its economy based on oil and real estate has been in a slump 
 exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> las <unk> complex in the suburb of irving 
 until the building is completed exxon will rent part of an existing office tower 
 las <unk> once a huge texas ranch is a <unk> complex of office buildings homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to <unk> in recent years 
 exxon officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at las <unk> than in new york 
 the company wo n't say how much it will save but during at its interim location sources say it will likely pay rent of $ N to $ N per square foot 
 owners of the building in new york say they will be asking $ N per square foot for rent to fill the space that exxon is <unk> 
 in texas taxes and development costs are also lower they said 
 plus one exxon official said by eliminating the typically long new york <unk> between office and home management will expect employees to work N hours a week in dallas rather than a <unk> work week in new york

 ima holdings corp. completed its $ N billion acquisition of american medical international inc. purchasing N million shares or N N of the los angeles-based health-care services concern for $ N a share 
 the price also includes assumption of about $ N billion in debt

 he indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt 
 then after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling ima early this month lowered its offer to $ N a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market

 treasury secretary nicholas brady said that congress should grant the securities and exchange commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis 
 in testimony to the senate securities subcommittee mr. brady disputed the view of sec chairman richard breeden who told a house panel wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets 
 mr. breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to <unk> about when the exchanges might be closed 
 he added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency 
 but mr. brady argued that the sec is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed 
 separately mr. brady said he asked the working group on financial markets to determine whether futures margins are too low 
 he noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the N crash 
 this raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate mr. brady said 
 margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract 
 margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility 
 the chicago mercantile exchange margins for the standard & poor 's N stock-index futures stood at $ N a contract for speculators and $ N for <unk> before oct. N N that day the hedging margin was raised to $ N 
 margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash oct. N N 
 currently they stand at $ N for speculators who are typically individuals and <unk> traders and $ N for <unk> which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks 
 mr. brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to end under its own weight 
 asked whether there is anything congress should do to curb the lbo boom mr. brady responded i think the lbo phenomenon while it wo n't stop completely will be a thing of the past 
 before taking any action he advised the panel to see what the market has produced as a cure 
 mr. brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility and said he <unk> that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks 
 but he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds 
 the former wall street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago 
 i do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time he said 
 but mr. brady endorsed the <unk> bill that both houses of congress will try to push through this session 
 that bill proposed by the sec last year would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets 
 the bill also would give the sec the power to close the markets a discretion that former sec chairman david <unk> wanted but mr. breeden does n't 
 mr. brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start <unk> the bill 
 the senate agriculture committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the futures trading practices act of N 
 the proposed legislation has a <unk> goal to assure the integrity of the u.s. futures markets 
 however as is common with sweeping legislation the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve 
 the complex bill introduced by sens. patrick <unk> d. <unk> richard <unk> r. ind. and bob <unk> d. neb. covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the commodity futures trading commission and would <unk> change the way the industry is regulated 
 these include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders and exchange <unk> 
 the bill also <unk> even minor rule <unk> to <unk> and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct 
 many aspects of the bill are <unk> providing appropriate public <unk> that can and should be instituted throughout the industry 
 indeed some of the bill 's requirements including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest already have been put in place by the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange and other futures exchanges 
 other aspects of the bill however are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges the industry and ultimately the general public 
 one of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker 
 the new york futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill 
 we would be <unk> to have such a system in place today 
 but is it realistic for congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been <unk> to <unk> studies 
 what if the system does n't work 
 what if the only system that does work is so expensive that at best only the largest exchanges can afford it 
 cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets 
 the u.s. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before 
 today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a <unk> 
 all foreign markets are aggressively <unk> u.s. business 
 in fact several london markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts 
 the u.s. exchanges need both market integrity and <unk> long-term growth depends on it 
 the senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading 
 the most <unk> of these is the <unk> of service fees which will directly widen the cost spread between u.s. and foreign markets 
 other provisions have a more <unk> but nonetheless real and <unk> effect on the international position of u.s. exchanges 
 these include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages 
 in addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members these measures could have other far-reaching <unk> 
 one section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct 
 nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or <unk> action a source of liability under similar circumstances 
 it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation 
 in an already <unk> business commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public <unk> the private individual of access to the markets 
 another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them 
 this <unk> concept would <unk> these firms to potentially <unk> punitive damages 
 faced with the virtually impossible task of <unk> the execution of each trade many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with <unk> and instead hire their own <unk> floor brokers 
 this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers 
 a consequence of their departure could be a serious <unk> of market liquidity 
 finally under the bill a number of legitimate longstanding business practices would be <unk> banned unless the cftc were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue 
 in other words regulation will occur through <unk> and <unk> rather than through a normal <unk> procedure 
 the affected practices include the placing of oral orders which is the way most public customer orders are placed and trading between affiliated brokers even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client 
 also <unk> would be dual trading <unk> a broker trades for customers as well as his own account a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets 
 all u.s. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision 
 nonetheless each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the cftc carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are 
 the markets are complex as is the environment in which they function 
 when problems surface the temptation becomes strong to <unk> overhaul a market system that has served for more than N years 
 that temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications positive and negative of the proposed resolutions to those problems and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades

 for the killer and thief said <unk> fame flows from the barrel of a gun 
 one man said you act as a <unk> a <unk> tells him a diversion to relieve people 's <unk> 
 mr. mahfouz 's cairo also has <unk> <unk> and <unk> wives who look to god not crime for their <unk> 
 but it is his portrait of cairo <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of streets filled with dust <unk> <unk> and animal <unk> that made his reputation and won him the nobel prize in N 
 three novels the beginning and the end N pages $ N the thief and the dogs N pages $ N and <unk> song N pages $ N recently published by <unk> offer an <unk> sample of the <unk> mr. mahfouz 's talent 
 but they do show the range of a <unk> <unk> whose <unk> novels span five decades and include work of social <unk> protest and <unk> 
 they also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author 's lifetime from a colonial <unk> of <unk> <unk> to a third world <unk> <unk> on its own refuse 
 soon it 'll be so crowded a <unk> complains that people will start eating each other 
 the beginning and the end easily the best of the three belongs to mr. mahfouz 's realistic period and it is the one for which he is most <unk> 
 published in N it follows the decline of a cairo family with the <unk> sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 a minor bureaucrat dies suddenly <unk> his family to poverty and eventual <unk> 
 his daughter turns to <unk> then to peddling herself for a few <unk> 
 one son <unk> his own career so that his <unk> brother can succeed while another helps support the family with money <unk> from crime 
 the real tragedy though lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances 
 <unk> for the father is <unk> by the shame of <unk> him in a <unk> 's grave 
 the family moves to another house at night to <unk> <unk> <unk> from neighbors 
 and the successful son wishes his embarrassing <unk> dead 
 as a <unk> of middle-class <unk> the story is <unk> 
 but its <unk> <unk> of cairo life are vintage mahfouz 
 we see <unk> and hear <unk> filled with the <unk> of <unk> advertising their <unk> <unk> with <unk> language <unk> <unk> and the sound of people gathering <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> into the street 
 and we meet engaging <unk> such as <unk> the head <unk> for his <unk> fights his <unk> and his <unk> 
 god has not yet <unk> that i should have earnings he tells his worried mother 
 <unk> comes to a bad end but so does almost everyone else in the book 
 if the setting is exotic the <unk> is closer to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> than it is to <unk> nights 
 mr. mahfouz began writing when there was no <unk> tradition in <unk> and he <unk> his work on western <unk> 
 in one sense this limits him unlike a writer such as <unk> garcia <unk> who has a distinctive latin voice mr. mahfouz 's style offers little that can be labeled egyptian 
 but the <unk> of his style also makes his work accessible as the streets of cairo come alive for the western reader as <unk> as <unk> 's london or <unk> 's st. <unk> 
 the thief and the dogs written in N is a <unk> psychological drama <unk> of crime and punishment 
 its <unk> said <unk> is an egyptian <unk> who seeks <unk> in <unk> and killing 
 i am the hope and the dream the redemption of <unk> he says in one of many interior <unk> 
 later he recalls the words of his marxist <unk> the people theft the <unk> fire 
 said 's story reflects the <unk> of socialism under <unk> whose <unk> rule replaced the <unk> <unk> in N 
 by N mr. mahfouz 's <unk> had <unk> or become <unk> as it has in said 
 his <unk> dream of <unk> a life of badly aimed bullets by <unk> the real <unk> the rich dogs who <unk> on the poor leads only to the death of <unk> and eventually to his own 
 cairo 's <unk> <unk> also has gone gray 
 here the city is dark and <unk> with <unk> said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of cairo society 
 while the theme is compelling the plot and characters are not

 the thief and the dogs is a <unk> work the first <unk> novel in <unk> but it is likely to <unk> western readers

 but the device <unk> more than it <unk> 
 buried in the work is a <unk> on the <unk> of art and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world 
 but again the themes get <unk> in mr. mahfouz 's <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> of his later work reflects both an appetite for new <unk> and the hazards of art in the arab world 
 mr. mahfouz has been <unk> and <unk> for questioning <unk> and <unk> peace with israel 
 <unk> his message has helped him endure 
 art says the playwright in <unk> song is the <unk> for the action that an <unk> like me is unable to take 
 <unk> song gives <unk> of a cairo that has become so much <unk> since his youth when as he once said the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty 
 the clutter of the <unk> remains but its color has <unk> away and the will to overcome has been defeated

 norwood partners limited partnership of boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of phoenix technologies ltd. 's common shares 
 norwood <unk> phoenix a <unk> maker of software for personal computers has had substantial losses in the past two quarters 
 its stock which was as high as $ N a share has been trading under $ N a share recently 
 yesterday it closed at $ N a share up $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 in a securities and exchange commission filing norwood said it 's part of a group that holds N phoenix technologies common shares or a N N stake 
 norwood has made no detailed plans but it has engaged in talks with other shareholders the filing said 
 phoenix declined to comment 
 norwood is controlled by daniel l. barnett and paul a. <unk> both officers of <unk> <unk> capital management inc. a small boston money management firm 
 also involved in the group is robert f. angelo formerly phoenix 's senior vice president field operations who left phoenix at the beginning of october 
 mr. angelo was described in the filing as a consultant to <unk> 
 weirton steel corp. said it reached a tentative agreement on a <unk> labor contract with the independent steelworkers union covering production and maintenance employees 
 the agreement subject to approval of union members would cover about N workers 
 the tentative agreement provides for wage increases of N cents an hour <unk> to sept. N N and for increases of N cents N cents and N cents an hour effective jan. N N N and N respectively 
 it also provides for benefit adjustments including a partial restoration of <unk> and holidays as well as <unk> changes to increase productivity 
 ground zero of the hud scandal is the secretary 's discretionary fund a <unk> pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal hud channels 
 jack kemp wants to abolish it 
 instead congress 's idea of reform is to increase this <unk> fund by $ N million 
 and transfer control of much of it to capitol hill 
 the hud scandals will simply continue but under new <unk> 
 after one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel <unk> the house voted N to N on wednesday to order $ N million in spending for a new jersey arts center a michigan library and N other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during sam <unk> 's tenure 
 hud has no paper work <unk> on N of the projects none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them 
 however four are in the michigan district of rep. bob <unk> the chairman of the house subcommittee that writes the hud spending bill 
 of course this kind of <unk> congressional <unk> is called <unk> service by members while the same kind of <unk> <unk> at hud is labeled influence peddling 
 unlike those awful republican consultants members do n't profit directly from hud projects 
 they merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office 
 the N pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for hud and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the house and senate versions 
 conference committees are breeding grounds for <unk> 
 they are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken 
 members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day 
 in this case the members <unk> themselves 
 rep. <unk> recently purchased an <unk> building lot on the island 
 this is slightly adapted from remarks oct. N by former secretary of state george p. <unk> to an <unk> gathering at the stanford business school where he has returned to the faculty 
 i was struck a couple of years ago by the <unk> effort in the <unk> 
 we had <unk> during the year an estimated $ N billion street value of cocaine 
 i do n't know how much got through 
 nobody has any credible estimate 
 the gnp of the <unk> is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars 
 so you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about 
 i welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem 
 the efforts to get to the people who are <unk> try to <unk> them if they can not be <unk> at least to contain them to educate people to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users to stop this process among the young all of these things i think are extremely important 
 but i have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work 
 the conceptual base a <unk> approach is the same that i have worked through before in the nixon administration when i was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the customs 
 we designed a comprehensive program and we worked hard on it 
 in the reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program we worked very hard on it 
 our international efforts were far greater than ever before 
 you 're looking at a guy whose <unk> was attacked in <unk> by the drug <unk> so i 'm personally a veteran of this war 
 what we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources <unk> into all of the efforts to enforce and control 
 these efforts wind up creating a market where the price <unk> exceeds the cost 
 with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it 
 it seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the <unk> out of the drug business and the incentives for <unk> out of it 
 frankly the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for <unk> to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that <unk> their cost 
 when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives including i might say the incentive that the drug <unk> have to go around and get kids <unk> so that they create a market for themselves 
 they wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market 
 so i think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way 
 if i am catching your attention then read a bold and <unk> article in this september 's issue of science by <unk> <unk> on this subject 
 we need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled <unk> of drugs 
 i find it very difficult to say that 
 sometimes at a reception or <unk> party i advance these views and people head for somebody else 
 they do n't even want to talk to you 
 i know that i 'm shouting into the <unk> here as far as what we 're doing now 
 but i feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now the next time around when we have the next <unk> of these programs it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it 
 no politician wants to say what i just said not for a minute 
 the u.s. economy grew at a moderate N N annual rate in the third quarter the same pace as the second quarter despite the worst trade performance in six years the commerce department reported 
 personal spending buoyed by a burst of automobile buying was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion 
 but trade one of the economy 's main forces in the past few years showed a sharp deterioration 
 imports of goods and services soared while exports were flat 
 some economists found the <unk> <unk> 
 for the past two years the foreign trade sector has been a major <unk> to economic growth 
 you ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path said norman robertson chief economist at mellon bank in pittsburgh 
 although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month 
 many economists think the rise in the value of the u.s. dollar this year will further <unk> progress in trade because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper 
 and business investment which slowed in the third quarter according to yesterday 's report is expected to continue to be sluggish 
 a sharp reduction in inflation was by far the <unk> spot in the report on the real gross national product the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced 
 an inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a N N annual rate in the third quarter from N N in the second 
 much of the <unk> came from declining energy prices which have since turned up a bit analysts said 
 consequently michael <unk> undersecretary for economic affairs at the commerce department said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of N 
 but he said he believes the second quarter 's N N rate will prove to have been this year 's peak quarterly inflation rate 
 generally the bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month 
 treasury secretary nicholas brady called the N N pace good solid growth although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter 
 he added inflation is lower than i think people expected it to be and i think that 's good news 
 but administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ N billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ N billion rate in the second quarter 
 mr. <unk> called it a disappointment but predicted exports will pick up again 
 we were <unk> for the deterioration in net exports said daniel van <unk> vice president of u.s. forecasting at bank of america in san francisco 
 i ca n't believe it will continue he added noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of u.s. products are still competitive 
 some analysts also were <unk> by a pickup in the growth of business inventories 
 while a buildup of these stocks adds to gnp it can hurt the economy because a <unk> of <unk> goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs 
 according to the report inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $ N billion in the third quarter up from a $ N billion pace in the second quarter 
 manufacturers ' stocks <unk> at an $ N billion annual rate up from $ N billion 
 that suggests there is a little more inventory <unk> than some people expected said edward boss senior financial economist at continental bank in chicago 
 i do n't think it 's anything that 's going to cause a downturn in economic activity 
 but it will slow production 
 devastation from hurricane hugo which <unk> into the southeast coast in late september diminished personal income by about $ N billion the department said but it called the effect on the roughly $ N trillion economy negligible 
 except for the loss from the hurricane all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation 
 here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant N dollars 
 in the third quarter the implicit price deflator fell to N N of the N average from N N in the previous quarter 
 northrop corp. received a $ N million contract by the u.s. air force for production <unk> and test equipment for the <unk> rainbow <unk> missile 
 the contract provides additional equipment for northrop the prime contractor on the missile and also supports a N purchase of N missiles for <unk> flight tests 
 general motors corp. 's chevrolet division said it is offering $ N cash incentives on all N models of its <unk> <unk> and suburban truck lines 
 chevrolet already has cash incentives on the N models of these vehicles 
 hudson 's bay co. announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected to raise about N million canadian dollars us$ N million net of expenses 
 proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem c$ N million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt the company said 
 canada 's largest department store operator said the rights offering will <unk> holders of its ordinary shares except residents in the u.s. and britain to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of c$ N a share 
 the record date is nov. N 
 the company has about N million ordinary shares outstanding 
 on the toronto stock exchange hudson 's bay shares closed at c$ N up N cents 
 hudson 's bay said that <unk> co. which currently holds about N N of the ordinary shares will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that are n't otherwise taken up 
 <unk> is a holding company owned by toronto 's thomson family 
 hudson 's bay said it will redeem N million series <unk> preferred shares on oct. N at a price of c$ N each 
 the move was approved at a special shareholders ' meeting yesterday 
 gary <unk> chief financial officer said redemption of the preferred shares originally issued at c$ N each will eliminate dividend payments of c$ N million annually 
 iverson technology corp. was one of the fastest-growing small companies in america until last year 
 the <unk> va. company <unk> computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands 
 from N to N its earnings soared <unk> to $ N million on a <unk> increase in revenue to $ N million 
 but in N it ran into a <unk> saw a defense department spending freeze 
 iverson 's earnings plunged N N to $ N million 
 the troubles continued in this year 's first half when profit plunged N N to $ N 
 iverson technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending 
 unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily these companies are suffering big drops in business as <unk> specialty <unk> in the massive military market erode or even disappear 
 companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive 
 as their <unk> strategies suggest there is more than one way to respond to a disaster though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off 
 for many companies the <unk> first response is to cut costs 
 others are trying to find specialty defense work <unk> by the slowdown or new <unk> created by <unk> 
 more <unk> businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields 
 <unk> international inc. which provides professional and technical services to the military is refining its defense niche not retreating from it 
 after <unk> annual earnings over four years to $ N million in N the <unk> va. company posted a N N drop in earnings for this year 's first half 
 in the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top defense department priority <unk> last year acquired <unk> <unk> associates a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the strategic defense initiative 
 while the sdi <unk> program recently awarded <unk> <unk> two contracts totaling $ N million <unk> 's chairman and founder jack <unk> says he bought the company more for its technology than its customer 
 <unk> inc. an <unk> md. contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N has gone even further in <unk> its military business 
 as orders for its aircraft and <unk> parts <unk> three years of steady growth ended with a N N drop in income in this year 's first half 
 the company hit on a new strategy if the defense department is so intent on saving money why not make money off that trend 
 among the company 's current efforts <unk> old parts at N N of the cost of replacing them 
 <unk> also is selling new parts if needed directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor 
 at as little as one-third of the government 's cost the company is running a program to train army helicopter pilots 
 it is also taking over the maintenance of certain navy aircraft with N N fewer people than the military used 
 in another approach tiny iverson technology is trying to resume its growth by <unk> the new world of commercial products 
 donald iverson chairman says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets 
 for now he says we 're looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal-computer business 
 earlier this month mr. iverson agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <unk> systems inc. salt lake city 
 the product <unk> an array of functions performed at small to <unk> printing companies 
 mr. iverson says there are N potential customers for the software in the washington d.c. area alone 
 <unk> inc. falls church va. also has acquired some companies outside the military market 
 moreover it 's trying to transfer its <unk> at designing military equipment to commercial ventures 
 a partnership with a <unk> va. unit of shell oil co. recently <unk> a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't <unk> in microwave <unk> 
 we 're trying to take the <unk> and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry says vincent <unk> <unk> 's chief executive 
 it is an effort to branch out from the government which is very difficult for a defense contractor 
 mr. <unk> should know 
 instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown dynamic engineering inc. a troubled subsidiary that makes wind <unk> for the space industry contributed to much of <unk> 's $ N million loss on $ N million in revenue last year 
 in january mr. <unk> sold the unit 
 it was our first acquisition he says and it was a mistake 
 some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best 
 <unk> corp. a santa <unk> calif. provider of <unk> and <unk> services to the military enjoyed steady growth until this year 
 following a <unk> of earnings to $ N million on a doubling of revenue to $ N million over four years earnings in the company 's fiscal first quarter which ended june N plunged N N to $ N 
 a one-time write-off for <unk> <unk> revenue was partly to blame but so were lower profits from a <unk> contract with the army and delays in getting paid 
 <unk> responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities says lin <unk> <unk> chairman and controlling shareholder 
 it 's evident we 're entering a more competitive era he says 
 <unk> corp. a sherman <unk> calif. defense contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting 
 the company not only merged three <unk> manufacturing operations but also closed an unrelated plant that makes <unk> devices used in fighter planes and missiles 
 the closing contributed to a $ N million loss in the fiscal first quarter ended july N its first quarterly loss since N 
 our <unk> business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's chairman 
 i would n't say we 're out of the business 
 but we 're not making as many <unk> devices as we used to 
 the growing crowd of japanese investors buying up foreign companies are n't all <unk> businessmen in dark suits 
 <unk> morishita whose art gallery last month became a major shareholder in christies international plc the london auction house is one man who does n't fit the <unk> 
 in japan he 's known in <unk> weekly magazines as the king of <unk> money 
 if nothing else the <unk> 's past has its share of <unk> 
 nearly N years ago mr. morishita founder and chairman of aichi corp. a finance company received a <unk> suspended sentence from a tokyo court for violating a <unk> law and an income tax law 
 he was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted and attempting to <unk> income taxes by using a double accounting system 
 he 's had other <unk> with the law 
 he was arrested though not indicted on at least three other occasions in the <unk> and <unk> for assault and unlawful <unk> for fraud and <unk> of private documents and for <unk> 
 christies says it has had no contact with mr. morishita since the stock purchase but that it 's happy to deal with him 
 we like to make our own judgments about mr. morishita says christopher <unk> christies ' group managing director 
 people have a different reputation country by country 
 mr. morishita is a leading figure among japan 's N <unk> which lend to small companies and <unk> which lend to individuals 
 many of these financiers lend freely often without demanding collateral 
 but the interest rates they charge are often near japan 's N N legal limit says <unk> <unk> a lawyer specializing in loan troubles 
 aichi is a <unk> mr. <unk> says and one of the nasty ones 
 in describing that business in general he says that when the client ca n't repay the loan some <unk> <unk> on like <unk> and even take over the client 's company 
 last month mr. morishita 's new gallery <unk> international ltd. purchased N N of christies for # N million $ N million 
 acquired from <unk> holdings u.k. ltd. a company owned by australian financier robert holmes a court the stake was apparently the first of its kind for <unk> an entity separate from aichi 
 and the acquisition which made <unk> one of christies ' top five shareholders left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were 
 we 're an investor mr. morishita says sitting back in his <unk> gallery filled with some N <unk> and <unk> 
 in the long run the stock prices will go up 
 it 's not clear whether <unk> plans to buy more shares 
 but christies mr. morishita insists is happy to see him become a long-term <unk> 
 mr. morishita considers himself a <unk> of art 
 in N years of collecting <unk> and japanese paintings he has acquired N items he says enough to persuade him to start a museum next year 
 he says he spent $ N million on his art business this year 
 a week ago his gallery racked up a $ N million <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in new york buying seven works including a <unk> 
 he makes <unk> judgments says <unk> <unk> the art gallery 's manager and mr. morishita 's secretary for more than seven years 
 mr. morishita 's main business certainly appears to be thriving although he wo n't disclose numbers 
 according to <unk> data bank ltd. which tracks company earnings aichi 's revenue rose N N to N billion yen $ N million in the year ended february 
 revenue doubled from two years ago 
 that is if the company reported results <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> a japanese daily last month reported that aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period 
 the tokyo regional taxation office declines to comment and mr. <unk> the <unk> 's secretary says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income 
 the small <unk> mr. morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world 
 stretching his arms in his <unk> white <unk> and <unk> his black shoes he <unk> a <unk> about the way to sell american real estate and boasts about his friendship with margaret thatcher 's son 
 but when asked what exactly he does in business he immediately takes <unk> 
 are you stupid he <unk> 
 you should know what questions to ask to get people to answer 
 not many people know the details of mr. morishita 's business but it 's a source of rumors about <unk> dealings 
 when a small company goes <unk> for instance the <unk> weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with aichi 
 mr. morishita <unk> at those stories as well as the ones connecting him to the japanese <unk> 
 he says he has never even <unk> with <unk> 
 the seventh child of a store owner in aichi <unk> mr. morishita started out in the textile business 
 from there he set up his finance company and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real estate to building golf courses

 the <unk> financier recently started <unk> in <unk> circles

 the los angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last friday that it had taken a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank the result of the state 's worsening real-estate market

 but it said that its consumer banks in oregon california nevada and washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by N N over the year-ago period 
 private-sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter but wage increases still are running above last year 's levels 
 the labor department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 
 the last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases mostly in N or N wages increased an average of N N a year over the life of the contracts 
 if this pattern continues the labor department said N will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase since N when the department started <unk> <unk> contracts with those that replaced them 
 this reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities 
 settlements reached in the first nine months of N called for wage increases averaging N N in the first contract year and N N annually over the life of the contracts the department said 
 for all of N union contracts provided for N N wage increases in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 
 in the second quarter contracts called for increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 
 the figures exclude <unk> payments and cost-of-living adjustments so the actual wage increases may have been bigger

 an enormous <unk> has succeeded where the government has failed he has made speaking filipino respectable 
 the N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a character who stars in the children 's television show batibot 
 he speaks only in filipino 
 batibot which started in N as a hybrid of the u.s. program <unk> street has developed into a <unk> philippine effort 
 radio programs and books have followed the daily television show 
 in the process batibot an <unk> filipino word meaning strong or <unk> has become a powerful advocate of the use of the filipino language 
 it <unk> on ordinary young <unk> that there 's nothing to feel <unk> about in using their own language says <unk> david a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show 
 when we started the program six years ago the use of filipino was deemed <unk> by the <unk> middle class says <unk> brown the program 's <unk> 
 now she says it 's no longer an issue 
 the success of batibot stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote filipino as a national language 
 filipino once known as <unk> is <unk> <unk> the <unk> language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of luzon 
 resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite who generally prefer english 
 but while <unk> <unk> are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as english they are often slow to reveal that they are <unk> against filipino say advocates of the native language 
 for the middle and <unk> class filipino is <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> professor at <unk> city 's university of the philippines 
 there 's also <unk> 
 other opponents of filipino come from <unk> regions 
 they argue that their own <unk> should have equal weight although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands filipino more than any other language 
 there are seven major <unk> and more than N <unk> in the country 
 what <unk> to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines 
 it is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the u.s. in philippine class structure in the regional <unk> of its people and in its island geography 
 as they did when the philippines was a colony of the u.s. teachers for the most part teach in english even though it is a foreign language for most philippine children 
 as a result they often speak one language at home another at school 
 mrs. brown calls the <unk> cultural <unk> to filipino a language <unk> 
 the issue has been <unk> for years 
 it does n't take much to <unk> an intense debate 
 when president <unk> aquino whose command of filipino is <unk> announced last year that the language would be used in official communications there was an <unk> from many legislators who continue to conduct debates mostly in english 
 but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling 
 they believe the media including batibot have played a crucial role 
 according to chief <unk> <unk> <unk> batibot does n't set out to advance the cause of filipino 
 it 's not as if we 're teaching language per <unk> he says we 're just using it 
 these days batibot is produced in a converted <unk> on a <unk> budget of $ N a one-hour segment 
 it is shown <unk> on two of the country 's five networks 
 with an audience totaling more than N batibot consistently ranks in the country 's <unk> <unk> <unk> programs 
 but advertising revenue is inadequate 
 <unk> there are threats that the program will <unk> 
 batibot lacks the polish of <unk> street 
 sound stages echo 
 acting sometimes falls flat 
 there are only two large <unk> in the program <unk> <unk> and a <unk> named <unk> <unk> 
 but the production is the equal of any local program 
 and the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies 
 the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment 
 not that the language war is won even on batibot

 black & decker said it plans to put other emhart units on the block in the future with the goal of raising $ N billion in net proceeds 
 black & decker <unk> emhart from the takeover bid of <unk> limited partnership last march by agreeing to acquire the maker of door <unk> and <unk> tools for about $ N billion 
 the move significantly expanded black & decker 's product line but also significantly increased its debt load 
 the acquisition boosted black & decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than N N 
 company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than N N over the next N N years 
 earlier this year black & decker put three emhart businesses on the auction block the information and electronics segment the <unk> electrical assembly business and <unk> <unk> 
 the three units had combined N sales of about $ N million 
 the three units contributed about a third of emhart 's total sales 
 in addition black & decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed emhart operations if it received the right price 
 <unk> is one of the previously <unk> units and the first of the five to be sold 
 the company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year 
 the five units generated sales of about $ N billion in N almost half of emhart 's $ N billion revenue 
 <unk> posted N sales of $ N million 
 our divestiture program is on schedule and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ N billion in net proceeds said <unk> d. <unk> black & decker 's president and chief executive officer in a statement

 <unk> in the budget being <unk> by the house-senate conference committee is something that looks <unk> and <unk> like a duck 
 it 's a <unk> tax on mergers 
 congress has decided to raise $ N million by charging companies $ N for the honor of filing the required papers under the hart-scott-rodino law 
 ever since the bad days of big is bad antitrust enforcement this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets 
 the <unk> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met 
 typically <unk> is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying <unk> 
 the $ N tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal but a serious drag on thousands of small friendly deals 
 one especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at justice and the federal trade commission 
 this amounts to a <unk> for regulators the more <unk> the more they get to keep 
 also as former reagan antitrust chief charles rule has noted this would establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government <unk>

 cie. de navigation mixte chairman marc fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ N billion bid by cie. financiere de paribas to bring its stake in navigation mixte to N N 
 at a news conference mr. fournier accused paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company whose interests include insurance banking <unk> <unk> sugar and orange <unk> 
 the chairman said his board members including representatives of west german insurance giant allianz ag and french banks credit lyonnais and societe generale hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital 
 mr. fournier said that as navigation mixte chairman he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business 
 but sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in navigation mixte which is being traded in london and is to resume trading in paris tuesday 
 at the same time he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying paribas 's bid 
 for the moment the sources said he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a <unk> for paribas 
 mr. fournier said navigation mixte 's N unconsolidated or <unk> profit is likely to be N billion francs $ N million up from N million francs last year 
 that is due mostly to payments from allianz for most of the N N stake it has agreed to acquire in navigation mixte 's insurance business 
 mr. fournier said the <unk> gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last 
 if holders avoid <unk> to paribas he added they can expect strong dividends again next year 
 analysts noted that over the past N years mr. fournier has built his company through <unk> stock-market activity and has <unk> off at least three takeover attempts 
 this time however some analysts think he could face a real battle 
 without some unexpected coup de theatre i do n't see what will block the paribas bid said <unk> de <unk> analyst at the brokerage <unk> & cie 
 mr. de <unk> said mr. fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid 
 paribas still needs the <unk> from the commission des operations de <unk> a government regulatory agency but analysts said that is considered likely 
 mr. fournier also noted that navigation mixte joined paribas 's core of shareholders when paribas was <unk> in N and said it now holds just under N N of paribas 's shares 
 once he realized that paribas 's intentions were n't friendly he said but before the bid was launched he sought approval to boost his paribas stake above N N 
 the petition is still pending but mr. fournier <unk> the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the <unk> paribas 
 one big question now is the likely role of mr. fournier 's allies 
 mr. fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital all strongly support him but some analysts said they are n't so sure 
 allianz for example has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral 
 paribas is allianz 's lead french bank 
 paribas said monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in navigation mixte to N N from the N N it already owns 
 the purchase of the additional N N stake is expected to cost more than N billion francs $ N billion 
 paribas says it will offer N francs $ N each for navigation mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights and N francs each for a block of shares issued july N which will receive only partial dividends this year 
 alternatively it is to offer three paribas shares for one navigation mixte share 
 the paribas offer values navigation mixte at about N billion francs depending on how many of navigation mixte 's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle

 the N tax reform act has nearly eliminated the number of large profitable corporations that do n't pay federal income tax according to citizens for tax justice a nonprofit <unk> research and lobbying group 
 in a study of N of the nation 's <unk> companies the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with N in N the last year the old tax rules were in effect and N in N when some of the new tax provisions went into effect 
 moreover N companies that paid no federal income tax from N through N despite billions of dollars of profits ended up paying an average of N N of their income in federal taxes in N 
 the report released yesterday comes as congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping <unk> legislation abolished or curtailed many <unk> 
 in the corporate <unk> the N law abolished the <unk> credit scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax a levy to ensure all <unk> businesses pay some federal tax 
 the combination of lower rates and fewer <unk> has meant that the so-called average effective tax rate the rate actually paid of the N corporations surveyed reached N N in N compared with N N in the years from N through N according to the study 
 in addition corporations are now <unk> a bigger share of the tax burden as the authors of the N law hoped 
 corporate taxes paid for almost N N of federal spending in N excluding social security compared with less than N N in the first half of the 1980s the study found 
 tax reform is working the study said 
 under the new <unk> law the days of widespread wholesale corporate tax <unk> have come to an end 
 still <unk> co. pinnacle west capital corp. <unk> corp. illinois power co. media general inc. santa fe southern pacific corp. and gulf states utilities co. did n't pay any federal income tax last year although they <unk> a total of $ N billion in profits the group said 
 in fact six of those companies received refunds which totaled $ N million 
 the lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments 
 this is the fifth year citizens for tax justice has released a study on corporate tax bills 
 earlier reports which revealed that as many as N companies were avoiding income tax legally have been credited with helping <unk> efforts to overhaul the tax code 
 but even though companies are paying more taxes many are still paying less than the statutory rate the report said 
 and N companies paid effective tax rates of below N N of their income 
 while the overall picture is very encouraging significant corporate tax <unk> continues the study said

 seven japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing bloomingdale 's chairman marvin traub and more than half are seeking additional information on the group bankers say 
 what mr. traub is hoping to put together investment bankers say is a management-led group to buy the new york department-store group that he heads from campeau 's federated department stores subsidiary

 gm 's common closed at $ N a share down N cents ford fell N cents to end at $ N and chrysler eased N cents to $ N all in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 the market 's <unk> reflects the gloomy outlook in detroit 
 as japanese auto makers gained market share the big three with gm in the lead slashed north american production and launched a retail discounting <unk> 
 the price war peaked in the third quarter as big three factory discounts climbed to more than $ N a vehicle according to industry officials 
 gm probably had the heaviest incentives said robert s. miller chrysler 's chief financial officer 
 we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them 
 but the costly efforts did little to slow japanese market gains and domestic car sales have plunged N N since the big three ended many of their programs sept. N 
 gm ford and chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter u.s. output plans an estimated N N from N levels 
 if sales do n't pick up the cuts will go deeper and incentives will <unk> again 
 ford which has long <unk> of its ability to weather a downturn saw earnings take a beating 
 the no. N auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production both the result of a substantially weaker u.s. market for a N N drop in net to $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 nearly all the decline came in ford 's u.s. automotive operations 
 the dearborn mich. auto maker ran a loss of $ N million on <unk> and marketing cars in the u.s. a deterioration of $ N million in that line from the N quarter 
 ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services 
 a year earlier ford reported record net of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 in the latest nine months ford earned $ N billion or $ N a share compared with $ N billion or $ N a share 
 the u.s. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had <unk> off N consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the N second quarter 
 but david n. <unk> vice president finance insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results better in this downturn than in prior <unk> when ford had net losses 
 still mr. <unk> said ford expects the u.s. economy to weaken through the end of N causing weaker sales and production 
 as a result fourth-quarter profit will come in below N results although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the N N third-quarter decline he said 
 part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ N million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit 
 in the N fourth quarter ford had net of $ N billion or $ N a share 
 chrysler 's operating profit fell to a <unk> $ N million or N cents a share its lowest quarterly total in seven years 
 its $ N million or $ N a share gain from the sale of N million mitsubishi shares made net $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales were flat at $ N billion 
 the results include record quarterly earnings of $ N million from chrysler financial corp 
 a year earlier chrysler 's net was $ N million or N cents a share 
 mr. miller said costs of incentives caused a moderate loss in the highland park mich. company 's north american car and truck business 
 he said the loss was n't that much different from ford 's $ N million loss on u.s. automotive operations but he declined to be specific 
 mr. miller said chrysler spent an average of $ N a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter compared with about $ N a vehicle a year earlier a <unk> mark at the time 
 he said chrysler is no longer sure of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of N million in the N model year 
 consumers he said are <unk> at higher prices on N cars especially after seeing the <unk> prices on N models 
 in the nine months net was $ N billion or $ N a share including the gain from the mitsubishi stock sale compared with $ N million or $ N a share after a charge of $ N million or N cents a share for plant closings in the N period 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 heavy losses in north american auto operations sent gm 's net tumbling to $ N million from a record $ N million 
 <unk> gm does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business 
 but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as much as $ N million on domestic vehicle operations 
 an N N drop in north american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on N model vehicles delivered during the period a gm spokesman said 
 but gm 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations 
 in one breakdown gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units electronic data systems corp. and gm hughes electronics corp 
 meanwhile gm said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ N billion 
 the diversified operations helped gm build its cash reserves exclusive of its financial subsidiary to $ N billion as of sept. N a N N increase from a year earlier 
 this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth-quarter north american production schedules more than the already scheduled N N 
 under the circumstances it wo n't be easy for gm to exceed its record N fourth-quarter net of $ N billion the spokesman acknowledged 
 that means it 's unlikely the company will <unk> last year 's $ N billion full-year profit even though net for the first nine months was up N N to $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion 
 it earned $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion in the N nine months 
 there are two versions of measure for measure on stage at the alley theater here 
 one is a strong vigorous portrayal of shakespeare 's play the other is director gregory boyd 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> rock <unk> on old vienna 
 measure for measure is one of shakespeare 's problem plays so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy comedy or history 
 its <unk> and uneasy <unk> of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in <unk> with directors just now 
 last season hartford stage director mark <unk> mounted a production at lincoln center and currently two other productions one just closed at the old globe in san diego and another now at the seattle rep <unk> with mr. boyd 's 
 in the play the duke of vienna <unk> over the <unk> of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the <unk> angelo hoping he can set things right 
 when angelo <unk> that the young man <unk> has made his <unk> pregnant before he could <unk> her angelo <unk> <unk> <unk> to death 
 when however <unk> 's sister <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> goes to angelo to plead her brother 's case the <unk> <unk> immediately falls in love with her and in a supreme act of <unk> demands that <unk> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life 
 meanwhile the duke who set the original scheme in motion appears on the scene <unk> as a <unk> and becomes involved in a series of <unk> that has everyone <unk> the worst possible outcome until the duke <unk> a last minute <unk> for all concerned 
 for the alley production scene designer peter david gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a <unk> platform of <unk> boards that <unk> into the audience 
 when the action requires a prison cell consisting of an <unk> wire <unk> rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform 
 in the play 's major scenes mr. boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the <unk> dynamic 
 when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> her brother <unk> <unk> <unk> in his cell explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom when <unk> and the <unk> duke philip <unk> <unk> to <unk> angelo and when <unk> <unk> jefferies a woman <unk> by angelo <unk> him with his past <unk> the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence 
 at such moments mr. boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior <unk> of shakespeare 
 when however he decides to be modern or more accurately when he decides to be trendy the results are far less satisfactory 
 mr. boyd is of the <unk> school that believes one must find modern parallels or <unk> to make shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences 
 it 's a valid approach but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of <unk> and taste 
 in his measure mr. boyd has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of vienna whom angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into <unk> <unk> <unk> and heavy metal types with a strong emphasis on leather chains and <unk> <unk> 
 loud rock music <unk> all the scene changes even those in the <unk> 
 when <unk> is arrested he is brought on stage <unk> except for the <unk> on his <unk> and <unk> 
 when the <unk> <unk> jack <unk> visits the <unk> to inform <unk> of her brother 's fate <unk> not only <unk> the mother superior on her rear but brings along a <unk> companion <unk> <unk> not in shakespeare 's script to <unk> <unk> 
 meanwhile the <unk> <unk> <unk> allen <unk> dressed in black leather and a prominent <unk> <unk> in enough <unk> gestures and <unk> <unk> to launch a space probe 
 the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination 
 the <unk> at one point for example of a list of <unk> <unk> <unk> ranging from jim bakker and <unk> helmsley to <unk> <unk> <unk> is a bid for a cheap <unk> <unk> of mr. boyd 's ability 
 despite the excesses however the <unk> for the production has many more <unk> than <unk> 
 what 's more it represents an important step for the alley theater 
 measure for measure is mr. boyd 's first <unk> <unk> as the theater 's new artistic director 
 he succeeded pat brown who was fired by the alley board N months ago 
 her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led peter <unk> head of theatre communications group to write an editorial in american theatre magazine <unk> the board 
 none of this backlash could change the fact that ms. brown 's regime was <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 now the alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts 
 not only is mr. boyd giving the theater a new sense of <unk> and excitement on stage the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in N years 
 as opposed to the $ N million deficit of the N season the N year concluded with a $ N surplus and a $ N cash reserve 
 <unk> last season 's runaway hit steel <unk> helped a lot but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board 
 only time will tell if mr. boyd can restore to the alley the <unk> it received when its founder <unk> <unk> was at the <unk> of her powers 
 but it is clear he is going to give it a shot 
 democratic leaders have bottled up president bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he intends to use senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least N votes before they can address the issue 
 and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes 
 the <unk> requirement will be there and they do n't have the N votes sen. mitchell said 
 they do n't have the votes to get it passed 
 sen. bob packwood r. ore. the leading republican <unk> of the tax cut did n't disagree 
 i 'm not sure what 's going to happen he said 
 previously he had said he would be able to find the <unk> N votes eventually 
 sen. packwood has offered his <unk> package as an amendment to a bill now pending in the senate that would <unk> aid to poland and hungary 
 democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a <unk> or extended debate 
 for a <unk> vote to stop the <unk> republicans must <unk> at least N votes 
 yesterday sen. packwood acknowledged we do n't have the votes for <unk> today 
 the republicans show no sign of <unk> 
 gop leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the eastern europe aid measure 
 and they threatened to try to <unk> any other revenue bill in the senate with the capital-gains provision 
 this is serious business we 're serious about a capital-gains reduction said kansas sen. robert dole the senate 's republican leader 
 the strategy is let 's vote 
 the republicans contend that they can <unk> a majority in the <unk> senate for a capital-gains tax cut 
 they accuse the democrats of unfairly using senate rules to <unk> a <unk> hurdle 
 democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends 
 the two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the packwood plan 
 democrats asserted that the proposal which also would create a new type of individual retirement account was <unk> with budget <unk> that would lose billions of dollars in the long run 
 republicans <unk> that <unk> revenue estimates were <unk> 
 the packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held 
 it also would create a new ira that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition 
 a white house spokesman said president bush is generally supportive of the packwood plan 
 marsh & mclennan cos. said it agreed to acquire the rest of <unk> & <unk> a leading west german insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a N N stake for N years 
 the transaction for cash and stock would represent the biggest european takeover since N for new york-based marsh & mclennan the world 's largest insurance broker

 <unk> barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next summer when big industrial companies will be able to buy insurance from carriers in any other ec country for the first time 
 that 's why we have been working hard to develop a single more unified presence in europe said <unk> smith marsh & mclennan 's president at a london news conference yesterday 
 analysts speculated that marsh & mclennan would spend between N million marks $ N million and N million marks for the rest of <unk> & <unk> or roughly N to N times the private firm 's estimated earnings 
 this is paying a big price to maintain their <unk> as the world 's leading insurance broker said philip <unk> an analyst at <unk> & <unk> a u.k. brokerage firm 
 earlier this year new york life insurance co. agreed to acquire windsor group ltd. a first step toward establishing a presence in the european market ahead of N 
 but most u.s. insurers have n't rushed to change the way they do business in europe because they believe the european market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies 
 under the proposed combination marsh & mclennan would gain a majority stake in <unk> & <unk> that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining N N 
 the three managing general partners would receive a significant number of marsh & mclennan shares said <unk> l. <unk> a partner who would also join marsh & mclennan 's board 
 mr. <unk> said he sought the combination because all our large clients in germany are becoming european companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker to serve them as well in paris as in germany

 the canadian government with a view to becoming more politically active in latin america is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the organization of american states a washington-based regional agency 
 the expected canadian move has been welcomed by the bush administration even though canada has opposed such u.s. actions as the trade <unk> against cuba the <unk> of <unk> and the military support for nicaragua 's contra guerrillas 
 latin american countries have long urged canada to join the oas in the hopes that it would be a <unk> to the u.s. which for many years <unk> to dominate the <unk> organization 
 even though the u.s. also has supported canadian membership it has n't been a washington priority 
 the fact that we might not side with the americans may be a reason why canada 's membership in the oas has n't been over the years an item high on the u.s. agenda said <unk> <unk> former canadian ambassador to the u.s. 
 the canadian application is expected to be announced in san jose costa rica by canadian prime minister brian <unk> who is attending a <unk> celebration of costa rican democracy 
 canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the <unk> mr. <unk> said recently 
 some canadian political <unk> have opposed canada 's joining what they see as a <unk> organization 
 canada could do plenty of things to get serious about latin america without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire between the u.s. and latin american members of the oas said jeffrey simpson a columnist in toronto 's globe & mail newspaper 
 canada at times could be an <unk> oas partner for the u.s. if its united nations voting record is an indication

 france voted the same as the u.s. N N of the time west germany N N and britain N N

 robert h. knight 's oct. N editorial-page article <unk> violence in comedy movies hollywood you <unk> me is interesting but somewhat <unk> 
 as a fan of older movies from the 1920s on i do not find modern <unk> contain violence sex and <unk> language to any greater degree than other recent movies 
 older movies have plenty of violence though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social <unk> of the time 
 for example one of my favorite movies is the N british comedy kind hearts and <unk> in which the entire comedy is based on actor dennis price 's <unk> eight titled <unk> all played by <unk> guinness because they <unk> his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title 
 similarly one of the most popular comedy <unk> of the 1930s and <unk> was the murder <unk> 
 the thin man series of movies as well as many others based their entire <unk> appeal on the star <unk> ' <unk> <unk> and <unk> as other characters in the movies were murdered 
 further i think mr. knight made a poor choice in picking a fish called <unk> as an example of the <unk> state of modern comedy movies 
 the specific scene he <unk> in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> in the old warner <unk> road <unk> <unk> 
 there is no <unk> <unk> <unk> portrayal of the animal 's demise 
 keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is <unk> by a <unk> only to pop right back up and <unk> in the window of a boeing N from the outside as it takes off 
 i will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making 
 many modern <unk> seem to be <unk> of writing drama or anything else without <unk> <unk> 
 sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script and high-tech special effects are continually <unk> for good plot and character development 
 in short we have a movie and television industry that is either <unk> or <unk> of making a movie unless it carries a <unk> or r rating 
 hence <unk> amounts of <unk> sex violence and <unk> language are included as a <unk>

 western european leaders who favor <unk> economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their <unk> the dizzying political changes under way in eastern europe 
 french president <unk> mitterrand european community commission president <unk> <unk> spanish prime minister <unk> gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the east to the need to speed up changes in the west 
 they are stressing that the best way for the west to help the east is to move faster <unk> western european economic and monetary unity 
 this would make the <unk> system more attractive to eastern countries they argue and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from west to east 
 the only response to the challenge being presented to us by the east mr. mitterrand told the european parliament in <unk> yesterday is to reinforce and accelerate the union and <unk> of the european community 
 mr. mitterrand proposed that a conference be <unk> next fall to write a new treaty for the ec allowing a european central bank and that the treaty be ratified by N 
 mr. mitterrand also proposed a separate bank for europe that would channel development money to the east 
 one basis for linking change in the east and change in the west is the notion that <unk> N million eastern europeans with N million western europeans is primarily the task of europeans despite the u.s. 's obvious strategic and economic interest 
 says a european strategist the u.s. tends to look at eastern europe not including the soviet union as europe looks at latin america important but far away 
 but for us in western europe these are europeans next door 
 a <unk> europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies 
 there is likely to be a natural division of labor says <unk> <unk> director of the international institute for strategic studies in london with the u.s. more engaged in strategic issues with the soviet union and western europe more involved with specific aid measures for the east 
 the <unk> at july 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the ec commission as coordinator of western aid to poland and hungary was a first step 
 in part this division is <unk> by economics west germany is a net exporter of capital while the u.s. is n't 
 while american aid efforts have been limited by budget problems yesterday france announced a three-year four billion french franc $ N million aid plan for poland 
 despite sudden changes in the strategic equation some western european leaders especially british prime minister margaret thatcher remain skeptical about european political and economic unity and are unlikely to let <unk> concerns change their minds 
 but british analysts are beginning to link the issues 
 we need a western <unk> says john roper of the royal institute of international affairs in london referring to west germany 's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the east 
 for poland and hungary we need to think about a <unk> economic approach that would force them to price things <unk> in return for removing all our tariff barriers 
 he notes that the marshall plan of u.s. aid to europe did n't just throw money at <unk> europe it also <unk> and opened up those markets 
 the french analysis goes further 
 most of the west 's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's policy of economic restructuring to succeed says <unk> <unk> security adviser to mr. mitterrand 
 but they have n't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions 
 he adds that with communism <unk> and mr. gorbachev scrambling to <unk> the soviet economy our interest lies in a controlled <unk> a contained nuclear reaction so we need to help him and not just with words 
 managing change he adds will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the ec especially in dealing with the question of german reunification 
 <unk> de <unk> director of the french <unk> for international relations in paris says it is n't clear what exactly west germany wants 
 any push for a gorbachev vision of a common european home <unk> the eventual <unk> of the ec a <unk> partnership and the withdrawal of u.s. forces would be a very very serious problem he says 
 he doubts a <unk> <unk> state will emerge that would dominate europe but warns of a risk of <unk> change in the heart of the european community from a germany that is too strong even if democratic 
 he adds we and the rest of the ec have to talk to the germans now frankly and raise these future risks with them 
 while many <unk> particularly french ones worry that <unk> and emotional reaction to the changes in the east might lead to dangerous pressures for a <unk> europe or the <unk> withdrawal of american troops mr. roper in london sees a more positive scenario 
 there seems to be a message from moscow there 's a deal on offer he says 
 they want <unk> we wo n't try to undermine or destroy the warsaw pact 
 in return the u.k. and france could keep their nuclear weapons 
 he adds once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the east

 sun a maker of computer workstations reported sales of $ N million for the quarter ended sept. N up N N from $ N million a year earlier 
 in the N period the company earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 sun 's results were slightly better than expectations 
 earlier this month the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $ N million 
 in a statement scott <unk> sun 's chief executive officer said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in april 
 one of those new computers called <unk> N accounted for nearly half of the N systems sun shipped in the quarter he said 
 more than two-thirds of the systems shipped meanwhile were products introduced in april 
 but problems in manufacturing forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer

 two old friends george bush and deng <unk> are trying to limit further damage to <unk> ties 
 but as congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against beijing the <unk> relationship could get worse 
 the problem for congress will be to weigh what china is saying to its people against the more <unk> message it is delivering to the bush administration 
 in a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation mr. deng sent an indirect signal to washington via <unk> lee a columbia university <unk> who met mr. deng and other chinese leaders in beijing last month 
 when he met with mr. bush on his return mr. lee says he told the president that the chinese made statements to me that i regard as a first step toward reconciliation 
 the communication mr. lee brought represents the softer line the u.s. has been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the june N massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 
 the chinese leader mr. lee informed mr. bush expressed some regret for what had happened in beijing and conceded that china 's officials <unk> some responsibility 
 mr. lee says mr. deng told him we should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed <unk> materials and went on <unk> strikes 
 mr. deng added says mr. lee that we really made mistakes 
 we must not <unk> our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators 
 mr. lee also reported to the president that in a separate meeting communist party chief <unk> <unk> said the chinese leadership looked <unk> on the students who took part in the demonstrations 
 mr. <unk> also pledged that the chinese red cross would publish very soon a list of those killed 
 and he told the <unk> that china 's leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families 
 i <unk> my conversations to the white house prof. lee says 
 but he adds i was not acting as a <unk> 
 he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president bush but that the white house <unk> invited him to do so 
 mr. lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in china but attributes that to the fact that the situation in china is very complex 
 according to u.s. sources in beijing the administration hopes mr. deng 's fairly <unk> comments will <unk> congress to be cautious about further sanctions against beijing 
 the president does n't want to have legislative sanctions says a u.s. official 
 but he may not have a choice 
 given china 's <unk> statements to its own people mr. bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions 
 beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of <unk> and <unk> against those who participated in the demonstrations 
 sentences have been stiff 
 a university student got eight years for participating in the rallies sources in beijing said while an <unk> worker got N years

 the house and senate are to begin soon <unk> out an agreement for sanctions legislation 
 it will probably be attached to a state department authorization bill which mr. bush is n't expected to veto 
 a congressional <unk> involved in <unk> the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those mr. bush enacted shortly after the massacre 
 but as legislative action they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to <unk> 
 measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges a suspension of most <unk> government contacts and a halt to u.s. trade <unk> programs such as the overseas private investment corp. and the trade development program

 labor and business leaders quoted at the white house rose garden <unk> hailed its provisions for <unk> corporate pension benefits 
 iras were like <unk> there 
 the ira 's conception is <unk> 
 in N then treasury secretary george <unk> with the key support of sen. carl <unk> sought some form of <unk> for the uncovered 
 that year a <unk> group headed by william <unk> in the legislation and regulations division of the office of the chief counsel for the internal revenue service was assigned the task of designing a plan 
 they used the N <unk> plan a pension plan created by a new york congressman for the self-employed as a partial model 
 this team initially called its new model personal retirement account or <unk> 
 but it did n't <unk> 
 so they opted for ira naming it after ira cohen a brilliant irs <unk> who helped them 
 ira himself confirms this account 
 ira rules have been changed over the years 
 one in N raised to $ N a year from $ N the amount a person could put <unk> into the <unk> accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans 
 this caused an explosion of ira promotions by brokers banks mutual funds and others

 ira account assets have grown to about $ N billion from $ N billion last year and just $ N billion in N 
 the soviet state bank announced a N N devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions in an apparent attempt to curb the nation 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency 
 the measure which will take effect next wednesday will create a two-tier exchange rate 
 commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about N rubles to the dollar 
 but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism the rate will jump to N rubles to the dollar 
 tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions 
 but it did n't elaborate and it remains unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut 
 the current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market 
 as soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade the <unk> has become ever greater 
 western tourists in the soviet union who could exchange a dollar <unk> illegally for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered N rubles or more 
 even at such rates black <unk> have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here 
 they use dollars to buy western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge <unk> 
 the going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ N in the west is anywhere from N to N rubles 
 even a pack of N western cigarettes can fetch N rubles or more 
 with more than N billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on soviet consumers <unk> at the <unk> <unk> prices for such goods but they buy them anyway 
 moscow has already <unk> admitted that the ruble is n't worth much announcing in august that it will pay soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of <unk> quotas 
 the <unk> of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone the afternoon newspaper <unk> wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation 
 the state bank 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible a goal that soviet bankers and economists say is still far away 
 rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in moscow for weeks but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise 
 it 's much bigger than we expected said one german banker who asked not to be named 
 the next step which could have a larger effect on businesses will come early next month when the bank for foreign economic affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency 
 soviet companies <unk> western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids 
 plans for the auction which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event have been <unk> by a lack of hard currency 
 soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate 
 the kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods 
 if foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new better exchange rate that would enable the state bank to increase its dollar reserves and would <unk> up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time 
 but the amounts they exchange may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors 
 unless other rules are changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help soviets who travel abroad 
 over the past three years thousands of people here have made use of <unk> travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad 
 but under current rules they are allowed to change just N rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip 
 at the new rate that would give them about $ N to travel on 
 it is n't yet clear whether the <unk> limit will be lifted 
 if it is n't the black market for dollars probably will continue to <unk> 
 international business machines corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of eastman kodak co. 's <unk> needs 
 but the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with kodak to archrival digital equipment corp 
 kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with maynard <unk> digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs 
 kodak based in rochester n.y. said ibm also had bid for the business 
 ibm is based in armonk n.y 
 the loss is a setback to ibm which pointed to the kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration 
 that 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide <unk> communications and computing services to major corporations 
 a kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract which is still in negotiation 
 he said that american telephone & telegraph mci communications corp. rochester telephone corp. and ibm itself would likely be digital 's <unk> on the project 
 when we decided to look outside the company for critical <unk> and communications services we wanted to get the best vendor for that service said paul allen the spokesman 
 that 's why we went with ibm for data center management and now digital for voice and data telecommunications 
 this year is the <unk> anniversary of the federal reserve system and some members of congress think it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank 
 after N years there may be a few things that are worth <unk> 
 the regional federal reserve bank <unk> for instance may be out of date 
 in earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give richmond va. a bank and allow los angeles only a branch of the san francisco bank but times have changed 
 maybe the whole regional system is an <unk> the fed after all is a national central bank 
 some of the would-be reformers however want to restore an arrangement we once had or at least part of it 
 in the beginning the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both <unk> <unk> members of the federal reserve board 
 but in N when congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the great depression it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board 
 carter glass a former treasury secretary who was then back in congress probably influenced the decision 
 he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think that was a good thing 
 times have changed 
 rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> has introduced a bill in congress <unk> by rep. lee hamilton d. ind. that would put the treasury secretary back on the board 
 there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress as in N would be doing something 
 so far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board 
 nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much 
 mr. <unk> has changed tactics dropping the <unk> idea 
 that may have pleased the secretary but h. erich <unk> chief economist of the investment firm of <unk> <unk> & co. suggests that mr. brady may figure he already has all the power he needs 
 like most treasury secretaries mr. brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters of course 
 he was in fact taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury 
 after the october N market crash mr. brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it 
 one of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency probably the federal reserve should coordinate regulation of all financial markets 
 this recommendation might have encouraged a <unk> bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job 
 the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in N and again in N it appears to have handled them well 
 mr. brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago 
 in recent weeks moreover mr. brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates 
 the urging <unk> has been <unk> 
 in an interview with the washington post in early october the secretary said the fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth 
 at least some economists of course would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis 
 earlier this month the st. louis fed held a conference to assess the system 's first N years 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> university economist noted that the fed 's record included the longest most sustained <unk> inflation in our history dating from either N or N to N 
 the <unk> argument is an old one but mr. brady on the board or off is surely trying to influence fed policy 
 equally <unk> the treasury secretary has <unk> the administration effort to bring the u.s. dollar down by shopping <unk> for west german marks and japanese yen 
 the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed 
 the central bank has been helping but apparently not especially <unk> 
 the fed has been <unk> in foreign currency markets all right but through august at least it appeared to be <unk> the intervention 
 in other words it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market 
 now <unk> intervention may have some effect 
 when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them <unk> a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do 
 but it 's generally accepted that <unk> intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values 
 after august the fed may have stopped <unk> but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar 
 the dollar is still highly volatile 
 the fed has let interest rates slip slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the friday N market drop only mr. greenspan and his associates know 
 earlier this year martin <unk> president of the national bureau of economic research argued <unk> that a government that wants steady stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies 
 trying to manage exchange rates to some <unk> level he said would mean <unk> monetary and fiscal policies from their <unk> roles and thereby <unk> excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation 
 the more we think about it the more we suspect mr. brady does indeed have enough power where he already is 
 this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron <unk> and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow 
 it has also been a week when <unk> washington has had a high old time <unk> over <unk> reagan 's multimillion-dollar <unk> in japan 
 the latter may seem oddly irrelevant if not downright <unk> given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to <unk> that impression 
 in fact however mr. reagan 's casual <unk> of the office he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something 
 our ability to influence the outcome of events in eastern europe and the soviet union is far more marginal 
 those events continue to move at a rate and in a direction which leave informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake 
 earlier this week soviet foreign minister eduard a. shevardnadze confessed that the u.s.s.r. ignored universal human values by <unk> afghanistan and to put it <unk> engaged in a violation of the abm treaty by building its radar station at krasnoyarsk 
 hungary is no longer a socialist peoples republic the communist party no longer has automatic delegates in the u.s.s.r. 's congress of peoples deputies and egon krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party <unk> when he took over as east germany 's new maximum leader 
 all of that is just for <unk> or so the hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding 
 of like though lesser note secretary of state james baker put the administration <unk> behind perestroika and glasnost and therefore behind mikhail gorbachev in a pair of carefully <unk> <unk> over the past week or so 
 and last but not least president george bush now views the changes in eastern europe as absolutely extraordinary and believes that mr. krenz ca n't turn the <unk> back in east germany because the change is too <unk> as he told the new york times 's <unk> apple jr 
 in other words after some highly visible <unk> and public airing of differences the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are <unk> from berlin to <unk> is a good thing to be welcomed rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with <unk> 
 all of this is what history will note assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down 
 for journalists however who write what they <unk> view as history 's first draft this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to ron and nancy 's sales appearance in japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder 
 it has been a <unk> transaction this <unk> away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office 
 the japanese <unk> has <unk> up at least $ N million the japanese government has put up just about as much or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total <unk> at $ N million 
 all of which has enabled those of us in washington who enjoy <unk> in such things to go into high public <unk> as mr. apple and i did the other night on abc 's <unk> 
 <unk> away we raised what i still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow but at the end of the affair there was just the <unk> nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target 
 as one of his defenders so <unk> put it president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well 
 he was performing for pay and why should anyone expect anything more 
 primarily because there 's more to the matter than ronald reagan 's personal values or lack of them 
 selling the presidency for a mess of <unk> is not so much a devaluation from the <unk> of public life today as it is a reflection of the <unk> of public standards 
 the theme song for the 1980s has been anything goes and it has been <unk> with <unk> from wall street to some of the highest <unk> of <unk> 
 there are those who say that this is nothing new that america has always suffered from a bad case of <unk> when it comes to the <unk> between what is <unk> and what is practiced 
 there is evidence to support that view 
 <unk> years ago william james wrote to <unk> wells the moral <unk> born of the exclusive <unk> of the <unk> <unk> success that with the <unk> cash interpretation put on the word success is our national disease 
 but if it was the national disease in N it is today the national <unk> 
 if there is no law against it do it 
 if the law leaves <unk> use them 
 if there is no moral prohibition that <unk> <unk> it full speed ahead 
 and if you are caught or if people complain simply argue that everyone does it or no one said i should n't and <unk> it out 
 as a last <unk> when all else has failed and you are <unk> <unk> for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong 
 see for instance jim bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this tuesday for <unk> the <unk> 
 consider the troubling <unk> between mr. shevardnadze 's speech of <unk> this week and the <unk> defense of everyone concerned with the iran-contra affair 
 the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated <unk> of behavior in afghanistan and just plain <unk> about the radar station 
 we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra and that apparently is n't going to change 
 for that matter those long ago identified as <unk> are still given <unk> hearings in the press 
 that is the key to the current national disease 
 no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the <unk> construction of the law 
 the <unk> media <unk> hunt about some politician 's private <unk> notwithstanding the general <unk> is to offer a version of the old <unk> who am i to judge 
 thus no standards no judgment and no values 
 you are mad because he 's making so much money say president reagan 's defenders 
 no we ought to be mad because he has <unk> the office we gave him <unk> it in the service of private gain just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth play <unk> games about their activities or to steal a phrase make public service a private trough 
 i 'm not going to be <unk> into <unk> to any of this president bush told mr. apple in this week 's interview 
 he was referring to the absolutely extraordinary events in eastern europe and it is a <unk> position 
 but there is no defense at all for the <unk> of the 1980s 
 we did n't <unk> into it we <unk> and slipped down the long <unk> and now we have as its <unk> symbol a former president <unk> for a foreign <unk> 
 or perhaps that is a <unk> symbol for the united states of N everything for sale nothing of real value 
 mr. carter is a political <unk> who heads a television production firm 
 cineplex odeon corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive <unk> drabinsky is considering bidding N million canadian dollars us$ N million to acquire the company 
 the board said mr. drabinsky and vice chairman <unk> <unk> are negotiating financing before offering c$ N a share to acquire all of cineplex 's shares outstanding 
 the directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders 
 the directors said if messrs. drabinsky and <unk> mail an offer to shareholders by nov. N it will reimburse them a maximum of c$ N million for expenses related to a bid 
 we consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last may to <unk> and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between mr. drabinsky and cineplex 's major shareholder mca inc 
 mca and cineplex 's other major shareholder <unk> financier charles bronfman and his associates have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by mr. drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder 
 mca holds half of cineplex 's equity and N N of its voting rights through restricted voting shares while bronfman interests hold about N N of the company 's equity 
 ms. <unk> said the committee had received other bids 
 she declined to identify other bidders but said mr. drabinsky 's offer is all cash and it 's for all of the company 
 several cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either <unk> low or for only part of the company 
 all this has really established is that mca and the <unk> have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> in los angeles 
 if a bid <unk> at that price shareholders will have every reason to be glad but the question of financing still remains 
 last april mr. drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to N N of cineplex for c$ N a share from bronfman associates 
 mr. drabinsky who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company 
 mca strongly opposed the drabinsky group 's move 
 the directors did n't indicate the source of financing for mr. drabinsky 's new proposal but said mca and the bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ N million and then lease back to cineplex its <unk> theater complex in universal city calif. if mr. drabinsky succeeds in an offer 
 this is being done at the suggestion of mr. drabinsky and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements ms. <unk> said 
 in addition the directors said if a bid by mr. drabinsky is successful cineplex expects rank <unk> plc to acquire the N N of cineplex 's film house unit it does n't own and provide mr. drabinsky with additional loan financing 
 michael <unk> rank 's chief executive said the british theater chain 's total involvement would n't exceed $ N million but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed film house purchase 
 cineplex shareholders responded <unk> to yesterday 's announcement 
 in trading on the new york stock exchange cineplex closed at $ N down N cents with more than a million shares changing hands 
 on the toronto stock exchange cineplex closed at c$ N off N canadian cents well below the c$ N level 
 where 's the bid asked pierre <unk> an analyst and broker with toronto securities dealer <unk> st. lawrence ltd 
 mr. <unk> said he does n't think messrs. drabinsky and <unk> are anywhere close to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again 
 mr. drabinsky could n't be reached for comment 
 two west german chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry 's standing among environmental groups and the general public

 mr. <unk> said hoechst will invest N million marks $ N million in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is <unk> 
 the company hopes the new plant likely to be built in frankfurt will be able to produce N tons a year 
 this year hoechst will produce about N tons of cfcs in factories in frankfurt spain and brazil 
 of hoechst 's N billion marks in group sales in N N million marks came from sales of cfcs

 <unk> coors co. said its coors brewing co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the west beginning early next year 
 the move which was expected marks the first time since prohibition that coors has sold a <unk> beverage and marks the company 's entry into a crowded but fast-growing market that generated about $ N billion in sales last year 
 coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide 
 <unk> sold by <unk> group of america a unit of source <unk> s.a. of paris and <unk> sold by a u.s. unit bsn of france are distributed to urban areas nationally but are less available in rural communities 
 coors with its large <unk> network could <unk> more markets 
 the company said the water will be called coors rocky mountain <unk> water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in coors beer 
 the company said it will sell the water plain and with <unk> and cherry <unk> and will package it in <unk> bottles and N ounce bottles as part of <unk> 
 the test markets though not specified will be in northern california arizona and colorado some of the hottest <unk> markets 
 some of america 's biggest trading partners gave a quick <unk> to a u.s. proposal to <unk> world trade and reduce <unk> subsidies 
 in geneva where world trade talks are being held under the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt the european community called the u.s. proposal a step <unk> 
 and japan 's minister of agriculture <unk> and <unk> told a committee of japan 's parliament that washington 's proposal was <unk> and that tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers 
 the u.s. in a far-reaching plan submitted to the geneva meeting tuesday proposed curbing price support subsidies within N years and eliminating export subsidies within five years 
 u.s. officials said the plan was flexible and was intended as a <unk> approach for gradually removing <unk> subsidies 
 but the ec reacted <unk> arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the common agricultural policy the ec 's $ N <unk> price support program 
 the american proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation the ec said in a statement 
 ec officials say they are <unk> that the u.s. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the elimination of export <unk> not just reduction 
 ec agriculture commissioner ray <unk> said the u.s. plan calls into question the agreement reached by world negotiators last april in geneva seeking substantial <unk> reductions in agricultural support and protection 
 u.s. deputy trade representative <unk> katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the april accord 
 he said he was surprised by the ec 's reaction calling it <unk> even <unk> 
 the u.s. proposal also was criticized by <unk> developing countries who said that the u.s. made no special <unk> for poor nations 
 while many experts argue that <unk> nations would eventually become <unk> in a free-market system the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime 
 ambassador katz said the u.s. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries 
 the u.s. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the <unk> goals would be achieved 
 the u.s. argues that its plan would ease the transition to <unk> agriculture trade by converting certain <unk> barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over N years 
 but the ec is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs 
 the new u.s. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports 
 it would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> 
 seeking to <unk> european concerns u.s. agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> said in washington that the new u.s. plan would n't put farmers out of business but would encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants 
 the ec with a population of N million has N million farmers while the u.s. with a population of about N million has only two million farmers 
 japan 's objections to the u.s. plan center around its desire to stay <unk> in rice a <unk> food even though foreign producers are far more efficient 
 bell atlantic corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of control data corp. 's <unk> businesses 
 terms of the accord were n't disclosed 
 control data 's <unk> maintenance unit services products primarily made by digital equipment corp. and international business machines corp 
 the unit has N customers and according to one analyst had N revenue of about $ N million 
 under the agreement which had been widely expected bell atlantic would be buying control data 's customer base and its approximately N u.s. maintenance facilities in about N cities 
 however control data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its <unk> product line 
 the unit represents a small portion of <unk> control data 's overall <unk> business which last year posted sales of about $ N million 
 earlier this year the company sold a similar unit in europe for about $ N million 
 lawrence perlman control data 's president and chief operating officer said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's strategy to be a data solutions company 
 thomas <unk> president of bell atlantic 's customer services division said the acquisition would give the company 's <unk> <unk> unit added expertise in the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies 
 two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and <unk> 
 these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars and from journalists as well 
 russell miller 's bare-faced messiah the true story of l. ron hubbard is a <unk> of the founder of the church of <unk> 
 mr. hubbard who died in N <unk> the <unk> on his <unk> to his church which licensed them to new era publications a <unk> corporation 
 in N new era sought a permanent injunction to restrain henry holt & co. from publishing bare-faced messiah on the ground that mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard infringed the <unk> 
 the publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits <unk> for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching <unk> or research 
 district court judge pierre leval denied the injunction on the ground that new era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine lawyers call <unk> 
 as for the merits judge leval said that mr. miller had written a serious book of responsible historical criticism 
 <unk> <unk> the judge believed was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about mr. hubbard <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> that could not be <unk> demonstrated without use of mr. hubbard 's own words 
 the <unk> judge leval wrote should not be required simply to express conclusions without defending them by example 
 in such circumstances <unk> interests <unk> the interests of the copyright owner 
 but judge leval felt <unk> by an earlier decision of the second circuit court <unk> a <unk> of <unk> salinger to quote from mr. salinger 's personal letters 
 he distinguished the two cases in salinger judge leval noted the quotations were for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> rather than of proving points about the subject 
 still the salinger decision created a strong <unk> against fair use of unpublished materials 
 judge leval <unk> concluded that a few of mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard 's unpublished <unk> because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the <unk> test and therefore infringed copyright 
 but the proper remedy judge leval said lay in a suit for damages not in an injunction 
 the case went on appeal to the second circuit 
 in a decision in april of this year judge roger <unk> joined by judge frank <unk> agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that bare-faced messiah was a serious work but rejected judge leval 's argument that the public interest in <unk> could outweigh the <unk> of copyright 
 we conclude the two judges wrote that <unk> is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction 
 had the suit been filed in time they said bare-faced messiah would have been <unk> 
 this was too much for james oakes the court 's chief judge 
 in a powerful separate opinion judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing out that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard 
 i thought that salinger might by being taken in another <unk> context come back to <unk> us 
 this case <unk> that concern 
 decisions by the second circuit itself judge oakes continued had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the <unk> in particular cases of <unk> quotations are vital components of fair use 
 and the injunction judges <unk> and <unk> would so readily have granted had new era sued in time 
 <unk> of the book judge oakes observed would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the first amendment 
 moreover and here judge oakes went to the heart of the question responsible <unk> and <unk> constantly use primary sources letters <unk> and <unk> 
 indeed it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information 
 now scholars in <unk> their responsibility do not claim the right to <unk> every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation 
 and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own <unk> or as donated or sold to <unk> 
 but in the bare-faced messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act 
 and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points 
 judges oakes and leval understand the requirements of historical <unk> 
 judges <unk> and <unk> do not appear to have a clue 
 yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law 
 as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly <unk> is controlling 
 if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished <unk> materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be <unk> 
 the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand take it to mean about N words 
 the bare-faced messiah decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise 
 a second decision handed down in august by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is another blow against <unk> 
 <unk> malcolm a professional writer on psychiatric matters wrote a series of articles for the new yorker later published in book form by <unk> under the title in the <unk> <unk> 
 the articles were largely based on interviews ms. malcolm had taped with jeffrey masson a <unk> who had served as projects director of the <unk> <unk> 
 mr. masson then brought a libel suit against ms. malcolm the new yorker and <unk> 
 as a public figure mr. masson had to prove <unk> and as proof of <unk> mr. masson contended that <unk> quotations <unk> to him by ms. malcolm were in fact <unk> 
 the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for ms. malcolm and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume the quotations were deliberately altered 
 for all <unk> and most journalists this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the malcolm articles 
 but judge arthur <unk> joined by judge cynthia <unk> hall took the <unk> position that it is perfectly ok to <unk> quotations so long as a judge finds that the <unk> do not alter <unk> content or are rational <unk> of <unk> remarks 
 in his <unk> dissent judge alex <unk> observed that when a writer uses <unk> marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words <unk> of <unk> and you know and <unk> error 
 while judges have an obligation under the first amendment to <unk> freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a <unk> of a free press 
 ms. malcolm for example wrote that mr. masson described himself as the greatest analyst who ever lived 
 no such statement appears on the tapes 
 the majority cited mr. masson 's remark it 's me alone against the rest of the <unk> world as warrant for the malcolm fabrication 
 but as judge <unk> noted the context shows that mr. masson 's me alone remark referred not to his alleged <unk> in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else 
 ms. malcolm had mr. masson describing himself as an intellectual <unk> 
 again no such statement appears on the tapes 
 the majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of mr. masson 's <unk> of himself as a private asset but a public liability to <unk> <unk> and that in any case it was not <unk> 
 judge <unk> found the <unk> entirely <unk> and writes that for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual <unk> is a devastating admission of professional dishonesty 
 these were only two of a series of <unk> that had in judge <unk> 's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive <unk> more <unk> and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements 
 as robert <unk> wrote in a review of ms. malcolm 's book mr. masson emerges as a <unk> <unk> and in the end a <unk> fool 
 but it is not <unk> malcolm who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile 
 we now know that the words were not always his own 
 there is one <unk> rule of journalism john <unk> has said 
 the writer must not <unk> 
 should the green light judges <unk> and hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice it will notably reduce the value of journalism for <unk> and for citizens 
 as judge <unk> put it to <unk> the right to deliberately <unk> what someone else has said is to <unk> the right to lie in print 
 masson has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more 
 the historical profession will survive these decisions 
 perhaps in time the supreme court will correct them 
 but writing history is tough enough without judges <unk> throwing obstacles in the scholar 's path 
 mr. <unk> is albert <unk> professor of the <unk> at the city university of new york and a winner of <unk> prizes in history and <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> N years old senior vice president marketing at <unk> entertainment inc. was named president of capitol records inc. a unit of this entertainment concern

 legal <unk> in america have a way of assuming a <unk> significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case 
 they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment 
 it has always been so 
 in the 1920s a young <unk> john t. <unk> <unk> to be a guinea <unk> in a test case sponsored by the american civil <unk> union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the tennessee legislature 
 the result was a <unk> trial <unk> <unk> cultural conflicts in american life between the smart set whose spokesman was <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> whom <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> 
 few now recall the actual outcome <unk> was convicted and fined $ N and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under tennessee law 
 so it was with the <unk> case a generation later when <unk> <unk> became a <unk> rod for the <unk> of the cold war and <unk> attitudes toward the new deal he had served 
 his trials aroused public <unk> out of all proportion to the rather <unk> secrets he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence 
 and so it seems to be with the case of elizabeth morgan the washington d.c. plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the <unk> of her daughter 
 dr. morgan has just emerged from the d.c. jail after more than two years ' <unk> for <unk> of court a <unk> to her many supporters 
 to the rest of us the case is a <unk> 
 it is what lawyers call fact intensive 
 it presents no great issue of legal principle no <unk> question of family law or the law of <unk> 
 instead it turns on the disputed and <unk> facts of who did what to whom 
 it is difficult if not impossible for anyone who has not <unk> over the thousands of pages of court <unk> and <unk> to have a <unk> opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy 
 certainly i do not 
 so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has <unk> over the minds of many not just in washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world 
 i suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of dr. morgan 
 the first is that it represents an intense battle in what james <unk> used to <unk> as the war between the <unk> 
 but although <unk> did so gently and <unk> many of dr. morgan 's supporters have taken <unk> 's <unk> title the male animal quite literally 
 the <unk> of the <unk> aroused by the case <unk> to its <unk> importance in the war that <unk> accepted as an <unk> part of the human condition 
 a second theme is the <unk> of social class and race in the public reaction to the morgan case 
 dr. morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools 
 as members of the black <unk> in congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed dr. morgan does anyone seriously believe that if she were an <unk> black <unk> woman congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill <unk> her 
 or that the president would have <unk> to sign the bill out of <unk> for her plight 
 to ask those questions is to answer them 
 finally the case of dr. morgan gave congress an opportunity to act with <unk> <unk> and to engage in one of its favorite <unk> <unk> the district of columbia government 
 the local government is <unk> in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same tv <unk> as other people in the area do 
 <unk> the d.c. government is <unk> for members of congress who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it 
 congress is <unk> from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit 
 yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed congress with almost <unk> speed before the judicial process had run its course and indeed while the morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court 
 the morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of dr. morgan 's particular situation 
 it may stand as a <unk> for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence

 gm class <unk> which represents a dividend interest in hughes earnings closed at $ N up N cents in big board composite trading 
 gm class e which represents a dividend interest in <unk> profit fell N cents to $ N on the big board 
 the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm 's north american automotive operations which are a primary customer for the <unk> electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit 
 profit at the unit fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share largely because of a $ N million one-time charge associated with hughes 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least N people by year end 
 even excluding the charge however net fell N N 
 in addition gm 's north american vehicle production fell N N from a year ago which hurt <unk> electronic 's earnings a company spokesman said 
 that decline was reflected in revenue for the gm hughes unit which edged down to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 in the nine months gm hughes net fell N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 at gmac net dropped N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier 
 gmac said its automotive financing and leasing business rose N N in the u.s. largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales 
 gmac profits are combined with earnings from the rest of gm 's operations and attributed to the company 's traditional common stock

 in the bidding war for public service co. of new hampshire united illuminating co. raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $ N billion from $ N billion apparently <unk> all other bidders 
 the bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court <unk> ps of new hampshire 's reorganization 
 they are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of new hampshire where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization 
 each of the four parties bidding for ps of new hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state 
 the new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for judge james <unk> the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case because the company 's stockholders unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans 
 in addition some of the proposals are so close that <unk> issues such as timing may play a more important role 
 the unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support new haven <unk> united illuminating 's new bid 
 they previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by ps of new hampshire 
 all of the bidders <unk> full payment including interest to secured creditors 
 united illuminating 's plan however offers more for unsecured creditors 
 <unk> <unk> counsel to the official creditors committee said that under the united illuminating plan unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $ N million accrued before ps of new hampshire 's jan. N filing for bankruptcy court protection 
 in addition they would receive some $ N million in payments for interest since then 
 mr. <unk> said that by next july they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to $ N million 
 other plans generally would n't pay unsecured creditors ' interest accrued since the filing 
 under united illuminating 's plan a new holding company would be formed to own the two companies 
 it would be <unk> by united illuminating holders and <unk> by current holders of ps of new hampshire preferred and common stock 
 ps of new hampshire preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock 
 united illuminating said the preferred holders total package would equal about N N of their claims 
 common shareholders would end up owning about N N of the combined company 
 as previously reported northeast utilities hartford conn. monday filed a bid it valued at $ N billion 
 that offer was endorsed by the shareholders committee 
 the other bidders new england electric system <unk> mass. and ps of new hampshire did n't change the value of their bids although ps of new hampshire changed its rate proposal 
 new england electric values its offer at $ N billion and ps of new hampshire values its reorganization plan at $ N billion 
 the bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to <unk> state regulation 
 however creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like 
 the state has endorsed the new england electric plan which promises to limit rate increases to N N annually for seven years 
 northeast utilities ' plan proposes N N annual increases 
 ps of new hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of N N rate increases followed by five years of N N increases 
 fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases however 
 previously it had proposed seven years of N N increases 
 united illuminating also amended its rate plan 
 the new offer assumes just five years of N N rate increases to be followed by <unk> increases under the usual hearing procedure 
 previously united illuminating had also called for seven years of N N increases 
 the bids and rate proposals generally assume the seabrook nuclear power plant which is completed will go into operation 
 most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the nuclear regulatory commission

 c. <unk> tucker will become president and chief executive officer of bell atlantic international inc. a unit of this telecommunications concern effective jan. N 
 mr. tucker N years old is currently vice president and chief operating officer of bell atlantic 's <unk> telephone unit 
 mr. tucker will succeed <unk> j. <unk> N who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement april N 
 richard breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone 
 it was after all only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
 but the lack of lines became painfully apparent 
 as the stock market <unk> into a 190-point free fall on oct. N mr. breeden found himself <unk> around the sixth floor of the sec from his desk where the new york stock exchange was on an open line to his assistant 's office where the commodity futures trading commission was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves 
 with other anxious calls pouring in he recalls i 'd either have to <unk> the new york stock exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk 
 it wo n't happen again 
 now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office and the <unk> computer has been moved next to his desk 
 it 's all part of a new command center 
 the changes in the office <unk> illustrate mr. breeden 's stance as the nation 's top securities regulator 
 like his predecessor david <unk> he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office 
 but unlike mr. <unk> who during the N crash damaged himself by saying rather <unk> that the markets might be closed mr. breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage using it to further his agenda for the sec 
 in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average the second-largest ever as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market 
 a veteran of another financial crisis the savings-and-loan bailout mr. breeden wants to have the sec regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls 
 more broadly he wants to modernize regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping u.s. financial firms compete in the global market 
 he believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs an area the sec does n't regulate directly but one where it <unk> influence both on wall street and in congress 
 also unlike mr. <unk> mr. breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda 
 as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress he is <unk> in the ways of washington 
 what 's more the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the <unk> commission enabling him to avoid the <unk> that frustrated his predecessor 
 but mr. breeden a <unk> securities lawyer has <unk> some of the <unk> issues facing the financial markets 
 for instance he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk high-yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market <unk> over into stocks 
 he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules 
 he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer 
 mr. breeden 's selection will be <unk> as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the sec 's <unk> pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on wall street 
 congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while 
 members of the senate banking committee know mr. breeden from working on the <unk> bill and the relationship generally remains warm 
 indeed during mr. breeden 's confirmation hearing last month senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times more often than they asked about his <unk> for the job 
 these days mr. breeden is winning <unk> in washington and on wall street for his <unk> role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market plunge and the following monday 's <unk> morning session 
 as a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence mr. breeden avoided making <unk> comments and worked to gather information critical to wall street and to other government agencies 
 not everyone has jumped on the breeden <unk> however 
 some in washington contend that it 's too soon to tell whether mr. breeden will help or <unk> the sec 
 i do n't think this was a real test says one congressional aide 
 it was a fairly <unk> weekend but my sense is if you had n't had richard breeden there it would n't have made much of a difference 
 for some at the sec an agency that <unk> its independence mr. breeden may be too much of a washington insider 
 they note that he has <unk> his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog <unk> 
 they worry that mr. breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the white house 
 but mr. breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the sec his way 
 during the monday market rebound a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down N points 
 stunned mr. breeden turned to his <unk> computer which by then was next to his desk 
 it showed the <unk> up N points 
 sec staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service quotron had <unk> the industrial average 
 mr. breeden instructed sec staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number 
 it was the plunge that did n't happen he says 
 mr. breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event the california earthquake to move another rule change past congress 
 that disaster closed the pacific stock exchange 's stock <unk> operation forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily 
 though <unk> to most investors the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in congress mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them 
 congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing 
 mr. breeden not missing a chance to press his agenda cited the earthquake 
 that event he contended simply shows the <unk> of having listings on only one exchange 
 in a corner of the <unk> new nippon convention center sits mazda motor corp. 's <unk> display

 welcome to the <unk> tokyo motor show 
 here you can find mitsubishi motors corp. <unk> a live fish <unk> a truck <unk> to an <unk> on wheels and nissan motor co. with its <unk> <unk> whose doors <unk> upon recognizing the owner 's <unk> 
 <unk> motor co. 's <unk> sport vehicle features a <unk> rear <unk> and invites drivers to go back to the nature 
 but this <unk> event the world 's largest display of cars and trucks has its serious side including the first major <unk> of future engines and <unk> systems 
 it 's also the prime <unk> for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged and <unk> lies the draw 
 even the biggest auto shows in the u.s. are largely regional affairs but the tokyo show is international 
 virtually every automotive analyst in new york showed up 
 <unk> flights were booked solid this week as motor city executives including ford motor co. chairman donald e. <unk> and chrysler corp. vice chairman gerald <unk> <unk> to see the future 
 even the soviet union came for the first time in N years to show off its <unk> <unk> sedan and its <unk> <unk> <unk> model 
 here 's a <unk> look at what the japanese hosts <unk> and what the foreign visitors saw 
 new technology 
 the hottest displays were items that <unk> passengers from <unk> <unk> and other <unk> of the road 
 these active suspension systems electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride 
 existing suspension systems try to absorb <unk> but active suspension provides power to counter the <unk> 
 nissan in a <unk> <unk> modestly compares its <unk> active suspension to a <unk> and <unk> the various parts to the animal 's heart brain nerves and blood vessels 
 toyota motor corp. <unk> touted its system in a car that <unk> in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings 
 nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the infiniti <unk> luxury sedan and toyota 's <unk> <unk> will go on sale with the suspension device next spring 
 but drivers in the u.s. must wait the japanese for now are keeping active suspension for domestic use only 
 and detroit 's big three auto makers say their systems are still under development 
 in the engine department several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space allowing for shorter <unk> 
 in the so-called <unk> engines which are expected to get sharply higher gas <unk> each <unk> goes up and down only once to provide power 
 by contrast the <unk> in conventional <unk> engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle 
 the <unk> engine displays by toyota and fuji heavy industries the maker of <unk> cars drew plenty of interest from u.s. auto executives who are rushing to develop <unk> engines 
 honda motor co. shows a more conventional <unk> engine in the new accord <unk> model which made its debut just this month in japan only 
 honda says the <unk> engine provides a compromise between the <unk> of a <unk> and the power of a <unk> 
 it is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <unk> line in the u.s. but honda officials would n't comment 
 odd cars funny names 
 there 's plenty of <unk> here but it is n't always clear whether it 's <unk> 
 the show 's symbol is a woman riding on a <unk> not your usual <unk> for speed and <unk> 
 but the sponsors have an explanation through the character associated with a <unk> they say important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought 
 japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high or low 
 honda has a tiny <unk> called the <unk> and a slightly larger <unk> the <unk> 
 mitsubishi has a <unk> delivery truck called the <unk> 
 mazda has the <unk> truck and under its <unk> <unk> a <unk> called the <unk> 
 its <unk> carol <unk> is designed with softness <unk> and <unk> 
 but the court <unk> appears to be japan 's smallest car maker <unk> motor co 
 one of its <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk> which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of <unk> in the rear 
 <unk> also has the fellow N the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> 
 the jokes are n't just on the japanese though 
 <unk> <unk> des <unk> renault the french auto maker has a concept car called the <unk> 
 the name is supposed to <unk> <unk> <unk> but in japanese it means <unk> 
 foreign presence 
 foreign auto makers are taking the tokyo motor show more seriously than ever 
 ab <unk> invites <unk> to play the role of the test <unk> by <unk> in a car that <unk> a crash to show just how its <unk> <unk> works 
 hyundai motor co. of south korea has its <unk> exhibit in tokyo 
 general motors corp. is <unk> its first independent display in N years and it includes a <unk> buick station <unk> with <unk> side panels 
 ford and chrysler also have <unk> although theirs are <unk> in a separate room with the <unk> automotive parts section 
 we 've got to get out of the detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality declares charles m. jordan gm 's vice president for design in explaining his <unk> to the tokyo show 
 even so traditional american <unk> is n't <unk> endangered 
 ford officials for example <unk> about their <unk> tokyo grand <unk> racing victory 
 true ford was declared the winner sunday but only after the honda driver who crossed the finish line first was <unk> because it hit another car and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> 
 mr. jordan of gm meanwhile still <unk> japanese <unk> 
 it 's hard for the japanese he says to get a feeling in a car to get a passion in a car to get <unk> in a car 
 regarding your sept. N politics & policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding iras why not compromise now and save the public from the coming <unk> congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process 
 the republicans maintain that a N N capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment while the democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded iras will raise revenue and spur savings 
 this is a classic example of the old saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts 
 it 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ N to pay the same N N <unk> tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ N 
 the N N <unk> should apply to all income over the applicable level not just the N N rate adjustment amount 
 it 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or <unk> tax incentive 
 jeffrey t. <unk> 
 pwa corp. said it plans to sell by spring N all N passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its N million canadian dollar us$ N million purchase of <unk> inc 
 pwa which recently merged <unk> 's operations with those of <unk> canadian airlines international ltd. canada 's <unk> airline said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt 
 pwa would n't estimate the value of <unk> 's aircraft which include N airbus <unk> and three boeing <unk> 
 but james ireland a miami-based technical analyst with <unk> inc. an aircraft evaluation firm estimated the total <unk> value of the N planes at about $ N million or more 
 mr. ireland said N <unk> aircraft that pwa also said it plans to sell beginning in N have a current <unk> value of about $ N million each or a total $ N million raising <unk> potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ N billion 
 mr. ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong partly because surging orders for new aircraft have <unk> waiting lists 
 he predicted that pwa would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers 
 under its revised fleet plan pwa said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight boeing <unk> aircraft to N by N and add four more boeing <unk> by N to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year 
 pwa said two of the boeing <unk> aircraft scheduled for delivery in N would be leased out for two to five years 
 pwa did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul but a toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $ N million us excluding replacement costs for the N <unk> aircraft that pwa plans to sell and purchase costs for as many as N airbus N aircraft that pwa previously ordered 
 i do n't see this as a debt reduction exercise 
 it 's focused on streamlining pwa 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft <unk> costs the analyst said 
 pwa 's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to c$ N billion at the end of the second quarter nearly double the year-earlier figure reflecting debt absorbed under the <unk> purchase 
 pwa said it also expects to announce by tuesday whether it will take delivery of all N airbus N aircraft it previously ordered 
 the first five leased units were to be delivered in N

 transportation secretary sam skinner who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his <unk> attacks on foreign investment in u.s. carriers now says the bill would further <unk> the jittery capital markets 
 texas rep. steve bartlett who has N american airlines workers in his district says the bill is good politics but bad law 
 it is ironic that at a time when america 's partial airline deregulation is being <unk> by governments from new zealand to ethiopia so many in congress favor an <unk> program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the soviet airline aeroflot 
 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress that the fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will <unk> some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply 
 mr. greenspan said he and other fed governors <unk> a bill by rep. stephen neal d. n.c. that would require the fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years 
 such a deadline is <unk> but it would have costs mr. greenspan told rep. neal 's monetary policy subcommittee 
 the fed chief opposed a bill introduced by <unk> lee hamilton d. ind. and <unk> <unk> d. <unk> that among other things would require the fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the fed 
 in responding to questions mr. greenspan played down reports of tension between the fed and the treasury over exchange-rate policy 
 what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said 
 he did n't elaborate 
 but the fed is n't enthusiastic about treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets and the treasury is frustrated at the fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value 
 mr. greenspan said the inflation rate currently about N N N could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but i do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output 
 in other words economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years 
 but mr. greenspan who has repeatedly said the fed 's goal is to reduce inflation added that whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter 
 he warned that fed efforts to <unk> inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily 
 rep. neal 's bill originally called on the fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter 
 he altered the <unk> to win mr. greenspan 's endorsement 
 even so his bill is given little chance of passage 
 <unk> hamilton and <unk> also have altered their bill dropping a proposal to add the treasury secretary to the <unk> fed committee that makes monetary policy 
 instead the bill simply calls for <unk> meetings between the committee and top administration officials 
 even that met with mr. greenspan 's <unk> because it might subject the fed to a more intensely political perspective and could risk <unk> monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals 
 while each of the <unk> proposals represents only a small step together they would erode the fed 's independence mr. greenspan said 
 mr. greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise <unk> in the tax reform act of N and result in higher marginal income tax rates 
 sears roebuck & co. signed a contract with bob vila the former host of the popular public television program this old house to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer 
 the <unk> show slated to start airing by june N marks sears 's entry into the <unk> market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products 
 in recent months sales of home improvement items have sagged along with sales of other big ticket durable goods 
 the show also signals mr. vila 's return as a television celebrity 
 earlier this year public television station <unk> in boston fired mr. vila after a sponsor <unk> some of his numerous commercial <unk> 
 with mr. vila as host this old house became one of the public broadcasting service 's top N programs airing weekly on about N of the network 's stations and seen by an average of N million viewers 
 but home <unk> inc. an atlanta-based home center chain <unk> when mr. vila started doing commercial <unk> for <unk> home centers a new jersey building supply company that competes with home <unk> in some markets 
 i 'm <unk> about the change said mr. vila whose new syndicated program is called home again with bob vila 
 in an interview mr. vila criticized his old show which is continuing with a new host 
 public tv is in fantasy land he said 
 last season we did a story that involved spending $ N in converting a <unk> house into a bed and breakfast 
 in the new show he said we 're going to spend $ N building a start-up house for a young couple 
 while sears would n't comment on the <unk> over mr. vila 's commercial <unk> it appears to be building a <unk> around mr. vila 's <unk> 
 his contract makes him exclusive spokesman for sears 's home improvement marketing campaigns 
 ogilvy & mather in chicago a unit of wpp group plc will handle the advertising account and <unk> 
 the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of <unk> home improvement and repair books 
 his other agreements to promote products have expired 
 little matter for mr. vila who complains that public tv never paid me more than $ N a year 
 he said his compensation under the sears contract is a <unk> dollar deal

 the white house has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation 's food supply 
 the proposed changes which are scheduled to be announced today would apply to pesticides and other <unk> found on fresh and processed foods according to federal officials 
 environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal 
 but they are already <unk> to among other things a plan to give more weight to <unk> considerations in evaluating pesticides 
 it 's a tremendous disappointment said <unk> <unk> an attorney with the natural resources defense council 
 allowing the epa to <unk> continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely <unk> to the environmental community 
 the bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that <unk> them 
 the principles would give the environmental protection agency increased authority and flexibility in <unk> pesticides with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly 
 there already are proposals pending in congress to overhaul pesticide law 
 moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year 's <unk> scare when the epa was <unk> criticized for failing to <unk> the possible <unk> a growth regulator used to make apples <unk> and <unk> 
 the agency has since acted to remove <unk> from the nation 's grocery shelves by may N N and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical 
 in addition the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called <unk> <unk> 
 under the <unk> clause which applies to processed food a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals 
 under other laws applying to pesticide use however that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the epa 's <unk> level 
 among other changes the white house wants to 
 give the epa more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace 
 speed up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an imminent hazard 
 bar states from setting more <unk> <unk> levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard 
 give the epa added discretion to set negligible risk levels for pesticide <unk> in processed food 
 chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred but those that fall below these levels would be allowed 
 allow the epa to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost 
 financial markets took a <unk> break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged 
 the dow jones industrial average lost N points to N in moderate trading 
 long-term treasury bonds rose slightly despite the <unk> on the market of $ N billion in 30-year bonds offered by the resolution funding corp. as part of the government 's bailout of the savings and loan industry 
 the dollar was barely changed against the west german mark and up marginally against the japanese yen 
 yesterday 's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the <unk> and plunging of stock prices tuesday after the proposed buy-out of ual corp. once again collapsed 
 traders said the stock market 's <unk> moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it <unk> some <unk> of stability 
 although bond prices were n't as volatile on tuesday trading as stock prices traders nevertheless said action also was much slower yesterday in the treasury market 
 bond investors paid close attention to comments by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who was <unk> before a congressional hearing but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the fed 's monetary policy 
 many analysts are expecting the fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year 
 investors now are awaiting today 's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product 
 economists predict the report will show economic growth of about N N in the third quarter which would have little effect on financial markets 
 but an unexpected deviation either way could <unk> bond and currency markets

 a few years ago i was on a panel of journalists that discussed the image of <unk> athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others 
 we <unk> quickly <unk> that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports <unk> earned but also that it could be corrected 
 competition could be maintained and stadiums probably would remain full if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students we said 
 comments from the audience reflected widespread if <unk> agreement with those conclusions 
 as the session broke up i was approached by a man who identified himself as the <unk> director of a big ten university 
 i 'd love to see sports cut back and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools but everybody 's afraid to make the first move he <unk> 
 it 's like the u.s. and the russians nobody wants to <unk> first 
 and so our institutions of higher learning <unk> from scandal to scandal on <unk> and basketball court while the <unk> mount 
 three new books make the point that one large price of the <unk> <unk> show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it 
 they are a payroll to meet a story of greed corruption and football at <unk> macmillan N pages $ N by david <unk> big red confidential inside nebraska football contemporary N pages $ N by <unk> <unk> and never too young to die the death of <unk> bias <unk> N pages $ N by lewis <unk> 
 the pick of the group is payroll it should be required reading for every college president 
 it <unk> how over a period of a dozen years southern <unk> university bought its way to football respectability in the southwest conference only to find itself trapped and <unk> by the <unk> system it created 
 the school was the first in N to receive the ncaa 's death penalty two years without football for repeated rules violations 
 given current <unk> about the university of florida it may not be the last 
 the man who brought the bribe to the dallas school was ron <unk> a flashy sort who came in N to rescue a <unk> program mr. <unk> writes 
 mr. <unk> 's personal style was illustrated by his <unk> a $ N bill to a high-school <unk> board on which other coaches tacked their cards 
 one <unk> working with mr. <unk> was so generous with $ N and $ N bills that prospects sang here comes santa <unk> when he approached 
 paying players at <unk> was no casual operation 
 it involved the athletics director two different football <unk> staffs and school <unk> and governors just about everybody it seemed but donald <unk> the university 's president 
 there 's a <unk> passage in which mr. <unk> having finally learned of the practice <unk> his <unk> to bill <unk> then a university governor and now the governor of texas and oil man edwin cox chairman of the board of <unk> 
 you stay out of it author <unk> quotes mr. <unk> as saying 
 go run the university 
 which was about what mr. <unk> did and quietly until he resigned a few years later <unk> ill health when the stuff hit the fan 
 mr. <unk> drew on <unk> news media coverage of the <unk> scandal and on a university internal investigation 
 mr. <unk> had to do most of his own <unk> on university of nebraska football which is to date high and dry as far as the ncaa is concerned 
 unfortunately he gets low grades as an <unk> reporter relying heavily on what chicago 's late mayor richard j. <unk> called <unk> 
 discrepancies go <unk> in confidential one <unk> claims he received $ N to $ N for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars and when mr. <unk> ca n't <unk> down something like who really owned a car driven by <unk> <unk> doug <unk> he simply <unk> his notes 
 there are <unk> <unk> to supposed romantic <unk> between <unk> players and a <unk> female university employee 
 a serious charge that star <unk> irving <unk> threw the N orange bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone is included even though the nebraska assistant coach quoted denied making it 
 still the book produces more smoke than a <unk> <unk> along with a few <unk> especially concerning the use of <unk> 
 dean <unk> a <unk> <unk> former <unk> <unk> that he used <unk> and says other <unk> did too 
 it 's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of nebraska coaches 
 probably it did n't 
 never too young is a different sort of work focusing on the N death from cocaine <unk> of bias a university of maryland basketball star <unk> for sure pro <unk> 
 while the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath 
 bias 's coach <unk> <unk> ordered the room in which bias died to be <unk> before the police could arrive the order was n't carried out and the school 's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of bias and other players 
 those of course were the responses of people with something to hide 
 one <unk> how other college athletic officials would <unk> under the same circumstances 
 tomorrow 's on sports column will look at another aspect of the college sports mess 
 <unk> of north america inc. a unit of daimler-benz ag paid massachusetts $ N million in taxes bringing to an end a <unk> corporate tax chase 
 officials at the department of revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court 
 but the check arrived in the mail said stephen kidder massachusetts commissioner of revenue 
 <unk> which had said it did n't owe taxes to massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a <unk> in baltimore and not in massachusetts did n't explain its change of heart 
 last month <unk> executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press the commissioner said 
 the dispute was the subject of a wall street journal article in august 
 the amount covers taxes interest and penalties owed from N when the state began collecting corporate taxes to N 
 <unk> also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years N through N mr. kidder added 
 under massachusetts tax laws corporations must pay N N of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company <unk> a variety of <unk> activities including <unk> customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships 
 national convenience stores inc. trying to shake the doldrums in the <unk> business said it will <unk> the merchandise in all of its stores in the next N months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores 
 as part of the plan the <unk> company 's N stop <unk> go stores will be <unk> to target black hispanic upscale or core middle-class customers 
 stores in <unk> neighborhoods for instance will carry high-priced wines publications such as <unk> fair <unk> pasta <unk> oat bran <unk> and weight watchers and <unk> products 
 stores in hispanic areas will stock an <unk> of <unk> magazines mexican cooking items and <unk> 
 stores in the company 's core middle-class market will get more frozen and <unk> foods and a greater selection of bottled water 
 <unk> van horn national convenience president and chief executive officer said the move reflects the company 's <unk> that the industry 's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores 
 convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences he said in a speech at the company 's annual shareholders meeting 
 analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who <unk> into a convenience store for a <unk> cigarettes soda or beer 
 there are an increasing number of people out there who are <unk> said chris <unk> retail analyst with alex brown & sons of baltimore 
 those are primarily white-collar workers a customer segment that has historically proved <unk> for convenience stores 
 national convenience 's move is likely to be <unk> by other chains though analysts note that <unk> corp. owner of <unk> stores and circle k corp. are too <unk> to roll out such an extensive effort 
 still <unk> said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years and that the company has begun to follow suit 
 for instance <unk> has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh <unk> in some outlets 
 several months ago it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores a spokeswoman said 
 we certainly see an increasing trend toward that she added 
 national convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in N stores with favorable results 
 analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put <unk> <unk> in N stores allowing national convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't 
 to promote its new strategy national convenience said it plans to spend about $ N million on advertising for the year ending june N up from about $ N million in fiscal N 
 labor secretary elizabeth dole named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the united mine workers and pittston co 
 <unk> <unk> jr. labor secretary during the ford administration was named to <unk> talks to settle the six-month strike by the <unk> 
 previous talks between pittston of greenwich conn. and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful 
 the union called the strike in april after pittston refused to sign the <unk> 's national labor pact 
 pittston seeks changes in health and pension benefits among other things 
 no schedule for formal talks was set but meetings are expected to begin soon 
 one day after delmed inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a significant drop next year in sales of its core product 
 that disclosure came a delmed spokeswoman said after the american stock exchange <unk> the company that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided 
 in addition to the forecast the company also said it is <unk> potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead 
 the spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of delmed stock today 
 delmed which makes and sells <unk> dialysis products used in treating kidney disease on tuesday announced the resignations of robert s. ehrlich chairman president and chief executive officer and of leslie i. shapiro chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
 they were succeeded by executives of fresenius usa inc. and its parent fresenius ag which owns about N N of delmed 
 at the same time the new <unk> n.j. company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the u.s. national medical care inc 
 following that announcement tuesday however company officials were unavailable to elaborate 
 yesterday the spokeswoman said sales of delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with national medical accounted for N N of delmed 's N sales of $ N million 
 the current distribution arrangement ends in march N although delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the <unk> dialysis products to national medical the spokeswoman said 
 nonetheless delmed currently expects that N sales will be significantly below their N level the company said in a statement 
 delmed said yesterday that fresenius usa would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels 
 in any case supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted the company added 
 fresenius a west german pharmaceutical concern has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between N N and N N 
 the transaction also would combine fresenius usa and delmed 
 but the plan now is being <unk> delmed said declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination 
 said the spokeswoman the whole structure has changed 
 the value of the company has changed 
 delmed did say that the proposal still would <unk> cash into delmed but less than the $ N million originally expected 
 delmed also would receive the north american rights to certain fresenius ag products 
 another option for delmed the company said is that it could sell its plant in ogden utah 
 it added that no discussions about such a sale are under way 
 brooks <unk> car service inc. never wanted to get into money laundering 
 but july N a <unk> in wilmington del. caused <unk> creek to rise N feet pouring N million gallons of water into <unk> <unk> 
 the water destroyed about $ N million in currency and <unk> $ N million of coins with <unk> <unk> them dangerous to counting machines 
 the $ N million in paper money although <unk> <unk> and <unk> was exchanged through the federal reserve bank of philadelphia without incident 
 but brooks was unable to reach a <unk> agreement with the government 
 we kind of got caught between <unk> says president william f. brooks jr 
 the u.s. mint would n't take the coin because it was n't <unk> and the federal reserve bank <unk> only clean coins he says 
 the philadelphia fed says it is merely an agent for coins responsible only for storage and distribution 
 we issue paper money we destroy paper money says <unk> <unk> a philadelphia fed spokeswoman 
 the coin is their problem 
 a mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its <unk> cost of $ N plus certain other expenses 
 but brooks declined figuring that <unk> the <unk> up money to washington would cost the company thousands more 
 so brooks gave the <unk> work to coin wrap inc. which came up with an unusual solution 
 for eight hours a day for the past two weeks in aggregates of as much as N pounds equaling $ N in pennies coin wrap has been pouring money into a <unk> truck 
 a giant <unk> working like a <unk> causes the <unk> to <unk> and burns off any <unk> 
 after <unk> around for an hour or so the <unk> hot money <unk> out of the cement <unk> where a giant vacuum <unk> away the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 after cooling the coins are then <unk> 
 brooks expects to pay coin wrap a total of about $ N a cost that insurance wo n't cover 
 and while the job is half done brooks is still bitter 
 in fact there 's only one person involved who 's happy and that 's <unk> string president of coin wrap and <unk> of the <unk> solution 
 not only did his company find $ N worth of work but when the approach was suggested mr. string says brooks officials did n't <unk> at me or anything 
 <unk> this summer 's successful and amusing movie about parents and children apparently was only the beginning 
 it seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother 's death or adoption or aging parents or pregnancy 
 and why not 
 some of our best and most <unk> film makers from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> allen have taken a <unk> from <unk> when it comes to compelling drama there 's no place like home 
 yet too many people working in hollywood today seem to suffer from the <unk> that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else 
 this is not the case 
 some <unk> simply are n't worth <unk> in 
 yet there will be people who will <unk> at immediate family a <unk> constructed and offensive movie about adoption 
 these are the sensitive <unk> who can <unk> with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles no matter how <unk> or predictably the sad tale is told 
 written by barbara <unk> co-author of the big <unk> immediate family takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children 
 the film makers have <unk> this offensive idea in pretty packaging 
 everyone is very nice and <unk> the <unk> parents glenn close and james woods and the <unk> couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption mary stuart <unk> and kevin dillon 
 linda and michael ms. close and mr. woods who seem to be pushing N live in a large and <unk> <unk> home in suburban seattle 
 all of their friends have children and they ca n't so now they want a child more than anything perhaps even more than michael wanted his fancy convertible or his <unk> stereo equipment 
 the idea of a <unk> must be <unk> them since the wealthy <unk> of their friends are shown to be <unk> <unk> in therapy by age five 
 having exhausted all modern aids to <unk> linda and michael decide to adopt 
 the actors wear <unk> <unk> to indicate their genuine <unk> for a little one or maybe they 're <unk> commenting on the <unk> of the script and jonathan <unk> 's the accused <unk> direction 
 or maybe they are <unk> by the <unk> musical score when a character <unk> at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of i can see clearly now 
 the adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother so linda and michael pay for pregnant <unk> 's ms. <unk> bus ticket from ohio 
 why in these movies is the <unk> pregnant woman always from ohio 
 i ask this not necessarily as a native <unk> 
 <unk> of course is pretty and smart though <unk> 
 everyone falls in love with everyone else 
 there is some pain when <unk> has the baby and did n't know she would feel like this and wants to keep the baby 
 but in the end everything turns out for the best in the film makers ' <unk> view 
 like lawyers in the hostile takeover field the baby goes where the money is 
 at the other end of the life cycle is <unk> gary david goldberg 's <unk> of the william <unk> novel 
 this picture is about a <unk> son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies 
 the <unk> emotional style mr. goldberg has <unk> on television 's family ties does n't benefit from <unk> 
 his characters practically <unk> through a vast range of human <unk> like travelers doing N cities in eight days 
 they <unk> only to register little <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of satisfaction like tourists <unk> the sights they 've seen from the window of a bus 
 not even jack <unk> 's expert <unk> makes this trip worth taking 
 so it 's entirely possible that look who 's talking is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the <unk> other films opening now 
 but by comparison this <unk> comedy seems like a <unk> 
 it starts with conception taking the <unk> 's point of view then <unk> to the baby 's point of view 
 bruce <unk> 's best attribute as an actor is his <unk> <unk> voice and that 's all you get of him here speaking for the baby 
 finally there is one family movie that quite <unk> <unk> the <unk> of human <unk> only its stars are bears 
 for the second time in a movie called the bear french director <unk> <unk> demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be 
 <unk> for fire was the first time 
 to be sure one <unk> what kind of man is this who feels <unk> to try to understand the most <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of <unk> <unk> 
 supposedly he proposed the movie to his producer <unk> <unk> in four lines 
 an <unk> bear <unk> 
 a big <unk> bear 
 two <unk> in the forest 
 the animals ' point of view 
 but then even a great many words could n't <unk> the extraordinary pull of this movie about an <unk> bear who <unk> a parent 
 video tip 
 one of the best movies about the <unk> thing in recent years was raising arizona the N <unk> brothers ' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door 
 westinghouse electric corp. <unk> on a major restructuring program expects operating margins of more than N N and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year top officers told securities analysts here 
 john c. marous chairman and chief executive officer also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise N N annually through the next three years 
 in N the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 since N westinghouse has shed N businesses that it did n't expect to produce N N operating margins while acquiring N businesses 
 in the past N months alone paul e. <unk> president and chief operating officer said the divestiture of $ N million of <unk> <unk> businesses has been more than offset by $ N million in profitable acquisitions 
 westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy 
 even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of N N to N N we can handle that mr. marous said 
 gnp is the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services 
 a bright spot is the company 's <unk> business which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years 
 mr. marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company 's target goal of N N 
 while westinghouse has n't had a nuclear power plant order from a u.s. utility in about a decade excess capacity is beginning to shrink 
 mr. <unk> said the company <unk> the need for a major boost in <unk> capability throughout the 1990s 
 westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam <unk> and gas <unk> plants to independent power producers 
 the company 's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with mitsubishi heavy industries mr. <unk> said 
 he said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as N N of near-term generation capacity adding we expect to supply a significant share of this market 
 westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to N N of total corporate sales from N N last year 
 the company is negotiating with the soviets to build a <unk> king <unk> plant that would produce about N units annually 
 mr. marous said westinghouse would own N N of the facility 
 the deal which will involve an initial $ N million investment was struck with a <unk> he added 
 company officials also said that any gain from the sale of westinghouse 's N N stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of asea brown boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter 
 the executives did n't disclose the size of the expected gain 
 capital expenditure in N will rise slightly mr. marous said from an estimated $ N million this year 
 short interest in international mobile machines corp. fell to N shares in the month ended oct. N from N in september 
 because of an error by the national association of securities dealers the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday 's edition 
 a proposed <unk> policy for federally funded <unk> researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures say financiers researchers and university administrators 
 the national institutes of health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses or lose their government money 
 among other concerns the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to <unk> findings in order to <unk> new drugs 
 as ties between <unk> and venture capital have <unk> in recent years <unk> fear of abuse has risen 
 but the guidelines could make it impossible to <unk> research says kenneth smith associate <unk> and vice president for research at massachusetts institute of technology 
 the nih is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until dec. N 
 after that it will make a final decision on the policy 
 the guidelines could <unk> future arrangements similar to the deal behind <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. start-up says robert daly a managing partner of <unk> associates a venture-capital firm 
 with $ N million he and other investors launched <unk> last year to market a <unk> cure being developed by researchers of the university of california at san diego 
 the researchers who are being financed by the <unk> funds will receive a royalty or percentage of sales if their research yields a commercial product 
 but because the university of california like many other universities shares its royalties with researchers it may <unk> itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines mr. daly says 
 the high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect 
 for instance commonwealth <unk> inc. a venture-capital concern last month invested $ N to launch <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. concern that will produce pharmaceuticals 
 scientists <unk> <unk> and paul <unk> conducted the initial research at the massachusetts institute of technology 
 while ms. <unk> left mit to head <unk> prof. <unk> will continue to work at mit serve on <unk> 's board and own a small equity stake in the company 
 the <unk> transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of <unk> biotechnology research 
 while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its <unk> says <unk> w. <unk> of commonwealth 
 this is the best way to transfer technology straight off the <unk> of universities 
 but the new guidelines could prevent scientists like prof. <unk> from being involved with <unk> such as <unk> venture capitalists point out 
 and if that happens the entire process of <unk> technology to the marketplace could be <unk> they say 
 the stakes in the controversy are large 
 last year venture capitalists spent an estimated $ N million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses according to the national venture capital association a trade group 
 many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to <unk> their work in return for an equity stake or royalties 
 in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track says lawrence <unk> of <unk> ventures la jolla calif 
 investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies he adds 
 but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work 
 without the exclusivity most venture capitalists wo n't have the incentive to invest in such deals mr. <unk> says 
 last year for example <unk> and others invested $ N million in <unk> <unk> inc. south san francisco calif. to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain 
 but before <unk> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology the federal register published most of the details giving all of the company 's potential competitors a chance to exploit it mr. <unk> says 
 <unk> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it 
 but says mr. <unk> it was a close call 
 the proposed guidelines could also delay <unk> and force small companies to waste scarce capital entrepreneurs say 
 if <unk> ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to <unk> it ourselves or do without the research says ruth <unk> manager of business development at applied biotechnology inc. a cambridge mass. concern 
 <unk> research is both costly and <unk> for a start-up ms. <unk> says 
 for its part nih insists that its guidelines should not <unk> research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use 
 universities such as harvard and mit should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists says <unk> <unk> who oversees the huge nih grants program as its deputy director for <unk> research 
 nih staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the <unk> of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures 
 not long ago scientists holding stock in <unk> pharmaceutical services inc. were accused of <unk> research to boost the stock 
 many officials are also concerned about companies getting a free ride on <unk> research 
 a congressional <unk> has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies <unk> their research 
 among other provisions the nih guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research 
 ms. <unk> the nih administrator says the business and scientific community is <unk> to what the agency merely meant to be ideas for discussion 
 the predictions of <unk> are <unk> she says 
 but when agencies like the nih <unk> guidelines they 've often already <unk> policy veteran scientists say 
 indeed institutions already are taking note 
 on sept. N harvard began circulating a <unk> policy statement that in effect would follow the nih guidelines <unk> 
 the university of california at san francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business 
 in many other institutions scientists are <unk> contacts with venture investors until the nih policy is settled 
 says mr. daly the venture capitalist it does n't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy 
 the damage is already done

 merksamer jewelers inc. a fast-growing jewelry store chain filed for chapter N bankruptcy-law protection from creditors apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain 
 the filing made yesterday in u.s. bankruptcy court here follows an agreement by l.j. hooker corp. merksamer 's owner to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price 
 ge capital corp. a financial services subsidiary of general electric co. is providing merksamer management with $ N million in financing 
 l.j. hooker based in atlanta filed for chapter N protection in august and has also announced its intention to sell its b. altman & co. department store chain 
 l.j. hooker is owned by hooker corp. sydney australia which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 l.j. hooker 's planned sale of merksamer is subject to approval by judge <unk> <unk> of u.s. bankruptcy court 
 rumors to the effect that the merksamer chain would file for chapter N arose last week in the jewelry industry 
 at that time sam merksamer president of the chain <unk> denied that his company was about to file 
 mr. merksamer is leading the buy-out 
 according to executives close to the situation merksamer filed for chapter N to speed the sale of the chain 
 one executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of l.j. hooker corp. had frozen in place all of l.j. hooker 's assets 
 the merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to <unk> that agreement 
 by filing for chapter N the merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale not the hundreds of unsecured creditors said this executive 
 the cash from the sale will go to l.j. hooker but the company itself will belong to sam merksamer 
 mr. merksamer and sanford <unk> chief executive of l.j. hooker were unavailable for comment 
 in a statement mr. merksamer described the filing as a legal <unk> but also said that our inability to obtain trade credit combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly <unk> for the christmas season <unk> our filing chapter N

 renaissance a <unk> money manager began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ N billion that it oversees for clients according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy 
 it was the first time since january that renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning 
 renaissance declined to confirm the move but its stock purchases were thought to have begun tuesday <unk> to <unk> with the maturity this week of treasury bills owned by the firm 
 the other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in treasury bills for the time being 
 wall street executives said they believed that renaissance 's $ N million buy program was carried out by painewebber inc 
 as reported painewebber bought shares tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift although the broker 's client was said then to have been japanese 
 yesterday painewebber declined comment 
 when it owns stocks renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about N <unk> issues to make buy or sell moves the firm <unk> wall street brokerage houses a day or so in advance looking for the best package price to carry out the trades 
 the broker winning the business does n't charge commissions but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price 
 that puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market 
 in tuesday 's <unk> session the dow jones industrial average fell by N points early in the day but finished with less than a <unk> loss 
 renaissance 's last portfolio shift carried out by goldman sachs & co. was a highly publicized decision last january to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy treasury bills 
 the sell signal which sent a bearish <unk> through the stock market came when renaissance 's computer found that stocks were <unk> compared with bonds and treasury bills 
 at the time the dow jones industrial average stood at about N 
 the dow average now stands more than N N higher while renaissance 's portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about N N through the first three quarters of the year 
 the computer 's <unk> has been painful for renaissance 
 almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results while renaissance has played it safe with treasury bills 
 so why does renaissance 's computer like stocks with the dow at N where it closed yesterday when it did n't with the dow at N 
 with the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates stocks are representing a better value all the time renaissance president frank w. <unk> said yesterday 
 three-month <unk> yields have fallen to N N from about N N at the start of the year 
 stock prices meanwhile are about N points lower than the peak of N reached on the dow industrial average oct. N 
 are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks 
 mr. <unk> wo n't say specifically explaining that if there was such a move it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction 
 during that time a buyer with the clout of a renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it <unk> its hand 
 but everything is relative to mr. <unk> so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or <unk> even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in january 
 our computer model has a certain trigger point he said 
 when the computer says switch renaissance switches 
 the firm has made N previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history 
 almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category following a <unk> style called tactical asset allocation 
 competing <unk> firms march to their own computer models so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while renaissance has sat on the sidelines 
 as a result competitors say renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in treasury bills 
 mr. <unk> confirms some clients have left renaissance but no major ones and the firm has added new accounts 
 david evans who last week resigned as president and chief executive of qintex entertainment inc. for personal reasons just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection has been temporarily <unk> to both positions the company said 
 qintex entertainment also said chief financial officer and treasurer jonathan lloyd N years old would join the <unk> board 
 he succeeds roger <unk> who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua communications co. was no longer necessary 
 mr. evans will stay until a successor is found but not later than the end of the year the company said 
 it was the <unk> mr. evans who had moved into the offices of mgm\/ua and run the company during qintex australia ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company 
 after mgm\/ua terminated the $ N billion merger because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit qintex entertainment which is <unk> by qintex australia found itself facing problems of its own 
 and the relationship between qintex entertainment and the australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating 
 on oct. N qintex entertainment was about to default on a $ N million payment owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program 
 qintex entertainment was depending on qintex australia to arrange financing 
 but early on oct. N the second of two hectic days of board meetings mr. evans said he believed qintex australia would n't be <unk> 
 he recommended that the company file for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code before the mca deadline according to a source familiar with the sessions 
 but a majority of the board which includes three members from the australian company <unk> him 
 mr. evans resigned 
 later in the day according to the source the board reversed itself decided to file for bankruptcy protection and asked mr. evans to stay on 
 mr. evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it 
 mr. evans could n't be reached yesterday for comment 
 last monday qintex australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets 
 last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to qintex entertainment 
 separately a qintex entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in los angeles charging qintex australia with misleading shareholders about qintex entertainment 's financial position 
 qintex australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment 
 the sept. N tracking travel column advises readers to charge with caution when traveling abroad because credit-card companies charge N N to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars 
 in fact this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad 
 in contrast to the N N conversion fee charged by visa foreign-currency dealers routinely charge N N or more to convert u.s. dollars into foreign currency 
 on top of this the <unk> who <unk> his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion 
 at the end of the trip any <unk> foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars with another commission due 
 the card holder will pay the modest N N fee only on the amounts actually needed 
 typically he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill 
 in the meantime the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder often more than N N during that float period alone

 mgm grand inc. has agreed to pay $ N million and nearly N million common shares to buy N acres of land along the las vegas nev. strip as a site for its planned <unk> and <unk> resort 
 of the total purchase price $ N million cash and $ N million in stock nearly N million shares would be paid to buy the existing <unk> marina hotel & casino from southwest securities a nevada limited partnership 
 the remaining properties to be acquired are the <unk> country club & golf course a facility jointly owned by ramada inc. of phoenix ariz. and the <unk> family and a small parcel owned by mgm grand director james d. <unk> 
 the purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with mgm grand 's planned offering of six million common shares 
 the luxury airline and casino company <unk> by investor kirk <unk> and his <unk> corp. earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties but did n't disclose the purchase price 
 the proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly N million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring mgm grand 's total shares outstanding to N million of which N N will be owned by mr. <unk> and <unk> according to the prospectus 
 in over-the-counter trading mgm grand was bid at $ N a share 
 proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company 's desert <unk> resort in las vegas <unk> certain aircraft of the mgm grand air unit and to acquire the property for the new resort 
 the company said it estimates the desert <unk> remodeling will cost about $ N million and the <unk> of the three <unk> aircraft made by mcdonnell douglas corp. will cost around $ N million 
 mgm grand said the latest stock offering wo n't cover the $ N million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park and added it will need to seek additional financing either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings at a later date 
 construction is set to begin in early N 
 the resort will include the mgm grand hotel a <unk> <unk> facility that will include N rooms and N square feet of casino space 
 the facility will be marketed toward families and room rates will be between $ N and $ N a night mgm grand said 
 the prospectus did n't include many details about the studio and theme park although conceptual drawings released this month show that it may feature several <unk> areas similar to those found at parks built by walt disney co 
 investors poured $ N billion more into money-market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields 
 assets of the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's money fund report jumped to $ N billion in the week ended tuesday the <unk> <unk> newsletter said 
 assets soared $ N billion in the previous week 
 meanwhile the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a <unk> of a percentage point the largest drop since <unk> 
 the average seven-day compound yield which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year fell to N N its lowest since late last year from N N the week before according to donoghue 's 
 lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of money fund report 
 money funds invest in such things as short-term treasury securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring 
 individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short-term instruments 
 the yield on six-month treasury bills sold at monday 's auction for example was just N N 
 the average yield on six-month cds of $ N or less at major banks was N N in the week ended tuesday according to banxquote money markets a new york information service 
 one way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period 
 the average maturity of the taxable funds that donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to N days its longest since august 
 they 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them slowly said walter frank chief economist for the donoghue organization publisher of money fund report 
 average maturity was as short as N days at the start of this year when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward 
 the average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached N N in late april 
 the <unk> funds are still above N N 
 the <unk> fund in the latest week was dreyfus worldwide dollar with a seven-day compound yield of N N 
 the fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas 
 it is currently <unk> management fees which <unk> to the higher yield 
 the average seven-day simple yield of the N funds fell to N N from N N donoghue 's reported 
 the average 30-day simple yield slid to N N from N N and the average 30-day compound yield fell to N N from N N 
 many small investors are facing a double <unk> this year they got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money 
 these people invested in leveraged junk bond mutual funds the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk 
 it 's a good strategy in a rising market where a N N leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have N N of their money working for them 
 the strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio 
 trouble is junk bond prices have been weak for months 
 thus the leverage has <unk> the funds ' portfolio losses 
 and shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold 
 that 's really where the leverage hurt says thomas <unk> a miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds 
 share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold in the junk market he says 
 leverage is never a problem for the traditional open end mutual funds which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all 
 leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds 
 the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock using the proceeds to buy additional bonds 
 the fallout for investors lately has been painful 
 consider the new america high income fund 
 with a leveraged position of about N N the fund 's share price has plunged N N so far this year 
 that 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio whose total return <unk> changes plus interest has amounted to a negative N N 
 such problems may not be over 
 leveraged funds in particular are still extremely vulnerable because we 're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market says george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates in <unk> mass 
 many investors are <unk> their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market 
 if someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold says gerald <unk> editor of the mutual fund letter in chicago they might shy away 
 in a typical leverage strategy a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money 
 if the market <unk> holders can make that much more profit the leverage effectively acts as an <unk> margin account for investors 
 but when the market moves against the fund investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged 
 fund managers for their part defend their use of leverage 
 carl <unk> who runs the colonial intermediate high income fund says the fund 's N N leverage has <unk> up its interest income 
 as long as i am borrowing at N N and each bond yields over that it <unk> the yield he maintains 
 mr. <unk> says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio 
 yet some funds have pulled in their <unk> 
 new america high income fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ N million in preferred stock and notes from investors 
 the fund made a similar move earlier this year 
 we are trying to increase our flexibility says <unk> e. terry a vice president at <unk> capital management the fund 's investment adviser 
 she declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund 's recent purchases sales or cash position 
 ms. terry did say the fund 's recent performance illustrates what happens in a leveraged product when the market does n't cooperate 
 when the market turns around she says it will give a nice picture of how leverage can help performance 
 several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay shareholders fund officials said 
 but a few funds have taken other defensive steps 
 some have raised their cash positions to record levels 
 high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls 
 prospect street high income portfolio for instance now holds about N N in cash and equivalents nearly <unk> the amount it held earlier this year says john <unk> portfolio <unk> 
 he says the fund which is N N leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds 
 i do n't want to be in a position to have to sell mr. <unk> says 
 other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash 
 at the <unk> zenith income fund portfolio manager john <unk> recently dumped mesa petroleum <unk> and <unk> industries among others to raise his cash position to a record N N 
 that 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money mr. <unk> says 
 he concedes this is the most difficult market that i 've been involved in 
 because of the recent <unk> turmoil the fund is considering investing in other issues instead including mortgage-backed bonds 
 we 're looking at the leverage factor every day says robert moore president of <unk> inc. a shearson lehman hutton inc. unit and the fund 's adviser 
 at some point if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost and at the moment we 're right on it we 're going to have to make a move 
 one of the more bizarre garden stories since <unk> has been <unk> for four years now in the private <unk> <unk> of artist <unk> bartlett 
 and if she and the battery park city authority have their way her <unk> <unk> plan will soon go public as a real garden <unk> in the downtown complex 
 south gardens as the bartlett scheme is called will <unk> the last N acres of open space at the southwest tip of manhattan 
 it could cost taxpayers $ N million to install and <unk> residents $ N million a year to maintain 
 created by an artist who <unk> her ignorance of plants and gardens south gardens as now planned will die from <unk> garden design 
 ms. bartlett 's previous work which earned her an international reputation in the <unk> art world often took gardens as its nominal subject 
 <unk> this <unk> connection made the <unk> fine arts committee think she had a <unk> green <unk> 
 ms. bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article 
 last year she <unk> to <unk> magazine i 'd never looked at a garden in my life 
 and she proved no <unk> <unk> in her initial statement to the bpca a new york state public benefit corporation the only thing i was interested in doing was a very complicated garden which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain 
 <unk> the bpca hired ms. bartlett and another confessed garden <unk> the architect alexander <unk> who claimed he had never visited much less built a garden and said of the project i do n't view this as a landscape 
 i view this as a building 
 the third principal in the south gardens <unk> did have garden experience 
 the firm of bruce <unk> <unk> landscape architects had created central park 's <unk> fields and shakespeare garden 
 the bpca called its team a stunning collaboration 
 after four years though the south gardens design is N N <unk> <unk> bartlett 
 she has done little more than <unk> her standard <unk> trees water landscape <unk> <unk> square houses circles <unk> <unk> and fit them into a grid as if she were making one of her <unk> <unk> works for a gallery wall 
 but for south gardens the grid was to be a <unk> network of <unk> or hedge walls with real plants inside them 
 in a letter to the bpca <unk> called this <unk> and <unk> 
 the landscape architects were expelled from the garden in july 
 all the while ms. bartlett had been busy at her <unk> <unk> in her sense of <unk> 
 as she put it in a N <unk> at the harvard graduate school of design i have designed a garden not knowing the difference between a <unk> and a <unk> 
 moreover she proclaimed that landscape architects have been going wrong for the last N years in the design of open space 
 and she further stunned her <unk> by <unk> her secret garden design method <unk> a friend to spend five or six thousand dollars on books that i ultimately cut up 
 after that the <unk> had been easy 
 i 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail 
 ms. bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client because i do n't think you can do <unk> versions of things 
 this was never a problem with south gardens because the client had long since given in to ms. bartlett 's every <unk> 
 last year the public was <unk> a <unk> of ms. bartlett 's creation in a <unk> version at a <unk> exhibition 
 the labels were <unk> within its <unk> walls is a <unk> of a thousand years in garden design a rose garden <unk> garden <unk> garden <unk> fields an apple <unk> organized in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to form rooms here and there are simple architectural forms a <unk> jet of water a <unk> of topiary or <unk> <unk> and chairs of every sort to drag around 
 at the core of it all is a love for plants 
 plant <unk> who studied the <unk> were alarmed 
 they looked at the <unk> and saw a giant <unk> 
 ms. bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or people 
 <unk> had put south gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room or about N humans overall 
 this <unk> of tiny <unk> <unk> was inspired by the artist 's own digs my <unk> was N by N feet so N feet by N feet seemed like a good garden room 
 inside the grid were N of these plant cells <unk> full of clutter 
 one she made into a topiary <unk> room <unk> with plants <unk> into a <unk> tv piano and chairs 
 in another she <unk> topiary <unk> missile <unk> costing $ N each in heights up to N feet 
 another she <unk> with eight <unk> hedges for a topiary <unk> lesson in the <unk> of plants 
 in the <unk> <unk> she specified a <unk> <unk> garden <unk> 
 she ordered the <unk> done in a different <unk> <unk> and made the landscape architects study a book on <unk> 
 in one garden <unk> she <unk> a <unk> square glass <unk> meant to show off a <unk> <unk> floor <unk> a <unk> sink a huge <unk> with <unk> and a <unk> with <unk> 
 next door she put a smaller <unk> glass house where she suggested a flat of <unk> might be displayed in the dead of winter 
 in another <unk> called the <unk> <unk> N <unk> trees were to be crowded together at killing <unk> of N or N feet 
 <unk> need about N feet 
 one thing about the bartlett plan was never in doubt it would demand the full-time skills of a <unk> of topiary <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 ms. bartlett <unk> suggested calling upon <unk> garden club workers for maintenance 
 furthermore she had insisted on <unk> so narrow five to eight feet and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment trucks or cherry pickers could n't maneuver 
 then to make these <unk> quite literally rooms ms. bartlett had thrown up <unk> walls brick <unk> hedge eight to N feet tall casting her <unk> into <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it was hard to see how <unk> would ever happen in south gardens without <unk> the walls in a <unk> array of <unk> 
 finally <unk> the bpca 's wishes to continue the popular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> views of new york harbor the <unk> of liberty and ellis island ms. bartlett threw up yet another wall this time concrete this time N N feet tall 
 she ran it the length of the south gardens <unk> <unk> out the city 's great natural water features the harbor and the river 
 within her garden she has <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> and other costly <unk> waterworks <unk> the hudson 
 while the model was still on view manhattan community board N passed a resolution against south gardens 
 the parks council wrote the bpca that this too private exclusive complex and expensive <unk> garden belongs in almost any location but the <unk> 
 <unk> b. miller the noted public garden designer who restored central park 's <unk> garden recalls her reaction to the south gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for <unk> street 's bryant park bryant park as designed in N failed as a public space because it made people feel trapped 
 by removing the hedges and some walls the bryant park restoration is opening it up 
 it seems to me the bpca plan has the potential of making south gardens a <unk> jail for people and plants 
 the three urban <unk> experts with cornell cooperative extension weighed in with a letter to the bpca that began we feel that the garden is <unk> doomed 
 they then addressed the <unk> questionable safety of a complex garden of endless <unk> places 
 the N <unk> hedges which <unk> views in and out of small rooms insure that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime 
 at harvard ms. bartlett had declared there are going to be problems with safety 
 i 'm not going to address questions of safety 
 despite the dire <unk> of knowledgeable garden professionals ms. bartlett 's south gardens design somehow continues on seemingly <unk> to reason stalled only by bureaucratic <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 bpca president and ceo david <unk> hopes to negotiate a <unk> that could be significantly more <unk> <unk> 
 and by <unk> yet another landscape architect nicholas <unk> he insists he can achieve that and other <unk> to <unk> reality while still preserving the artistic vision of a truly great artist 
 after four years of no progress in this direction it is doubtful any viable collaboration with ms. bartlett will suddenly now be possible 
 mr. <unk> has said he plans to go with the grid regardless 
 there is still time however for gov. mario <unk> or <unk> <unk> chairman of the bpca board to prevent this topiary <unk> <unk> 
 these <unk> might take counsel from william robinson author of the english <unk> garden the <unk> 's <unk> since N who seems to have had a <unk> bartlett in mind when he wrote <unk> our <unk> for ages have suffered at the hands of the <unk> artist when applying his designs to the garden 
 it is this <unk> of absurd <unk> ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a <unk> garden has to be made that leads to bad and <unk> design wrong in plan and <unk> for the life of plants 
 i read the <unk> of wayne <unk> 's exchange with a <unk> representative put the soviet economy on golden <unk> editorial page oct. N with great interest since the gold standard is one of my areas of research 
 mr. <unk> is incorrect when he states that the soviet union 's large gold reserves would give it great power to establish credibility 
 during the latter part of the 19th century russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than N N of its outstanding currency but no one outside russia used rubles 
 the bank of england on the other hand had gold reserves that averaged about N N of its outstanding currency and bank of england notes were accepted throughout the world 
 the most likely reason for this <unk> is that the bank of england was a private bank with substantial earning assets and the <unk> rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in britain 
 by contrast in <unk> russia an <unk> government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose much as it would in today 's soviet union 
 the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for <unk> the currency 
 it is no <unk> that from N to N when the bank of england was an independent private bank the pound was never <unk> and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended but with the subsequent <unk> of the bank of england the pound was <unk> with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined 
 the soviet union should keep these <unk> in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency 
 one way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a swiss bank with distributions based on swiss laws 
 unless the laws determining the <unk> 's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes however a <unk> ruble would be as unsuccessful for the soviets as it was for the <unk>

 securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing circuit breakers to halt program trading at volatile times 
 mr. breeden in his first testimony to congress since taking the sec post said the agency is studying the friday the 13th market plunge including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following monday 
 after the study the sec would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or <unk> the current ones he added 
 circuit breakers designed to give the markets a <unk> in cases of sharp price movements curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points 
 at certain points during the friday the 13th drop circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market slowing trading at times 
 a circuit breaker that would have closed down the new york stock exchange was n't <unk> 
 rep. edward markey d. mass. chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb turmoil in the marketplace 
 he argued that program-trading by roughly N big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors 
 mr. breeden did n't reject the proposal 
 after the sec study of the drop is completed he said i 'm perfectly happy to work with this committee in identifying whether we need other devices such as a program-trading curb 
 mr. breeden backed most of the provisions in a <unk> bill that the sec brought to the subcommittee last year under <unk> david <unk> 
 the measure is expected to move through this congress 
 but the new chairman <unk> opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress 
 mr. breeden contended that uncertainty over when the sec might act could worsen volatility in the markets 
 he argued that the current <unk> system allows investors to know precisely when and where any trading <unk> will occur and how long they will last 
 mr. breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill 
 one would force brokerage houses to provide the sec detailed information about loans made by their holding companies 
 such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms 
 he also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a <unk> basis 
 that information he argued is critical to <unk> sharp market moves such as the one nearly two weeks ago 
 in a rare package sale of its real estate k mart corp. <unk> mich. has sold N of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by new york developer philip <unk> according to sources familiar with the transaction 
 they estimate the value of the transaction at close to $ N million 
 k mart officials and mr. <unk> would n't comment on the sale 
 k mart previously had announced it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday the same day the real estate deal was completed 
 analysts are estimating third-quarter earnings will drop between N N and N N to about N to N cents per share compared with N cents per share in the year-ago quarter 
 it is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings 
 k mart developed the centers which range in size from about N square feet to just over N square feet 
 most are <unk> by a k mart store 
 the retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer who plans to expand the small centers 
 the centers <unk> a total of about N million square feet of retail space 
 they are spread around the country and include locations in california florida washington and arizona 
 mr. <unk> who heads <unk> international holding corp. a new york-based real estate company owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which k mart is a <unk> 
 the company is active in office and residential development in new york 
 however nationally mr. <unk> controls through limited partnerships about N shopping centers with about N million square feet 
 k mart runs N k mart stores primarily in leased facilities

 so much of the stuff poured into its austin texas offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it 
 now thousands of <unk> <unk> and sales pitches go straight into the trash 
 we just do n't have the staff to deliver it nor do we have the space or the time says a spokesman for the <unk> ill. electronics company which has N employees in the austin area 
 it 's the <unk> problem and the weight problem we have 
 motorola is in good company 
 businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore literally 
 while no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail direct-mail advertising firms say the number is growing 
 general motors earlier this year said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its <unk> mich. office while air products & chemicals <unk> pa. says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing 
 why the <unk> 
 anybody with a <unk> can answer that sheer overwhelming <unk> volume 
 according to the direct marketing association total direct mail to both businesses and consumers jumped N N to N billion pieces in N from five years earlier 
 though direct mail to businesses is n't broken out separately the association says it 's growing even faster 
 the <unk> has spurred <unk> companies to action with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it 
 the direct-mail industry not surprisingly is <unk> at the <unk> of it all 
 after all this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect that is the <unk> of so many jokes that television 's l.a. law <unk> <unk> david as short <unk> intensely <unk> and <unk> boring 
 the practice of businesses throwing out junk mail is a commonly known problem and it 's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board right down to the <unk> level says stephen <unk> a list consultant and chairman of the direct marketing association 's <unk> council 
 but it 's like <unk> the hand that feeds them because every one of these companies uses direct marketing 
 it 's almost impossible to track the number of companies <unk> junk mail since the decision is usually made in the mail room not the board room 
 and the practice often <unk> from location to location even within a company 
 but industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump <unk> sent to titles rather than to individual names 
 motorola 's austin operation was one of the first to lose patience deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual 
 magazines are n't delivered at all even if an individual 's name is listed employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library and are told to change the <unk> to their home addresses 
 at air products meanwhile the <unk> staff opens junk mail and often throws it away even if addressed to an individual 
 if they get N <unk> of something they open one see what it says throw N away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate a spokesman says 
 direct marketers were especially alarmed when general motors one of the country 's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself entered the <unk> battle 
 as of march N its <unk> office with about N employees stopped delivering bulk mail and <unk> magazines 
 employees were told that if they really wanted the publications they would have to have them sent home instead 
 the reason <unk> especially of <unk> magazines 
 direct-mail executives see gm 's stand as an <unk> sign even if the <unk> <unk> did bring it on themselves 
 why anyone would want to close themselves off from direct mail a <unk> does n't make any sense says michael bronner of bronner <unk> associates a boston <unk> firm 
 it <unk> of big <unk> 
 they 're going to decide what their employees can or can not read 
 the practice is however legal in most cases 
 jack ellis a u.s. postal inspector in new york says the postal service 's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room once it gets there a company can do with it what it wishes 
 the <unk> <unk> ever optimistic are looking for ways around the problem 
 so far they say it has n't had any <unk> effect on response rates 
 and before it does they 're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place 
 among other things the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on <unk> 
 we 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot <unk> says jack miller president of <unk> corp. a <unk> ill. <unk> mail-order company 
 but then again mailing less and <unk> wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway

 senate democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading senate proposal 
 their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the house 
 nevertheless oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member on the <unk> senate finance committee last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure <unk> u.s. aid for poland and hungary 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds perhaps as soon as today 
 mr. packwood all but conceded defeat telling mr. mitchell i sense at this stage you may have the votes 
 the two lawmakers <unk> in a highly personal fashion violating usual senate <unk> 
 their tone was <unk> with mr. packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and sen. mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again 
 although the proposal <unk> by mr. packwood and sen. william roth r. del. appears to have general backing by republicans their votes are n't sufficient to pass it 
 and democrats who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the <unk> cut are finding reasons to say no at least for now 
 a major reason is that they believe the <unk> plan would lose <unk> of revenue over the long run 
 the <unk> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held 
 it also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition 
 a number of us are not going to touch capital gains iras or anything else unless it <unk> to deficit-reduction said sen. charles <unk> d. va. who is one of the N to N democrats who the bush administration believes might favor giving <unk> treatment to capital gains 
 president bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the white house 
 and at a <unk> meeting tuesday of democratic senators there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year according to participants 
 the trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success 
 there is a <unk> shot of getting it this year said sen. david boren of oklahoma a leading democratic <unk> of cutting the capital-gains tax 
 he called the battle <unk> 
 other democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic 
 there will be no capital-gains bill this year said sen. dale <unk> d. ark 
 i 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal 
 the ira portion of the <unk> plan is irresponsible 
 another significant factor in the <unk> debate is the extent to which it has become a <unk> political battle between president bush and senate majority leader mitchell 
 mr. mitchell has made clear to his <unk> colleagues that the issue is important to him personally 
 today sen. mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to <unk> the proposal 
 estimates requested by sen. mitchell from the congressional joint taxation committee show that the <unk> N taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains <unk> of $ N million each in N the last year for which figures are available 
 white house officials acknowledged yesterday that democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <unk> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck sen. mitchell 
 as a result the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with senate democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut 
 democrats asked in this week for discussions with president bush have suggested ways of <unk> with the <unk> proposal suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back one official said 
 in addition white house aides think that there are numerous other important measures democrats badly wanted passed such as the <unk> back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with democrats 
 a capital-gains tax cut might be <unk> with such measures to help ensure passage 
 other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage 
 if they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future even next year 
 but the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the house and the senate

 they contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests the tribune said

 in addition <unk> were beginning to report these <unk> as well

 president bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto 
 vice president quayle and budget director darman said recently they 've joined the search 
 on tuesday the subject came up again when marlin fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the white house press corps 
 president bush does n't have any provision in mind but <unk> <unk> will be like <unk> at midnight in the coming continuing resolution 
 the harder question is whether anyone yet understands that mr. bush 's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law 
 we have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since N when lawyer stephen <unk> first made the case on this page 
 the N budget reform passed over president nixon 's veto took away the presidential <unk> power thereby introducing <unk> <unk> and <unk> the presidential veto 
 mr. <unk> discovered that the <unk> had worried that congress might take the president out of the <unk> 
 article i section N clause N says that whether it 's called an order resolution or vote or anything else presidents must have the chance to veto 
 <unk> an omnibus budget a bill ca n't <unk> the president of his power to veto items 
 finding a test case should n't be hard but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible 
 the white house had the perfect case but congress <unk> before it could go to court 
 after the hud and s&l stories broke some congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at <unk> and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble 
 they worried about an interior department <unk> to <unk> all communications with members or their staffs 
 congress inserted the following into the interior <unk> none of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the <unk> of the interior and members and committees of congress and their staff 
 the white house warned that this would be an unconstitutional <unk> of its power 
 when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto congress <unk> 
 the fear congress has of any <unk> test led members to add the single most <unk> and ridiculous provision this year this section shall be effective only on oct. N N 
 this means interior contacts can not be <unk> only on one day a sunday that had already passed 
 if the white house is looking for another unconstitutional bill rep. john dingell is trying again to raise the fairness doctrine from the dead 
 president reagan vetoed this as a first amendment violation 
 the fairness doctrine 's enthusiasts are <unk> in the house who know the rules <unk> <unk> discussions on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 there are also other provisions requiring congressmen to join <unk> teams and new restrictions on <unk> 
 unconstitutional bills make good legal targets but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere <unk> for lawyers 
 commenting on the budget mess this week president bush said the perception out there is that it 's the fault of congress 
 and you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the american people 
 exactly right 
 now 's the time to make the political case that presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget 
 congress is in no position to <unk> mr. bush now that we 're into gramm-rudman 's <unk> 
 just this week the house-senate conference met N conferees divided into N different <unk> 
 senator daniel inouye agreed to close some bases in hawaii in exchange for such <unk> as $ N million for a parking lot at walter reed hospital 
 conference negotiator rep. bill <unk> pulled down $ N million in military bases for north carolina and <unk> allowed senator james <unk> $ N million for bases in tennessee 
 president bush should take the constitution in one hand and a budget <unk> in the other and get to work 
 he should <unk> out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork 
 congress may have lost any sense of discipline but that does n't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess 
 president bush has the power to change how washington works if only he will use it 
 troubled sci television inc. proposed to restructure much of its $ N billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations 
 the leveraged buy-out firm of kohlberg kravis roberts & co. which owns N N of the common equity of sci tv indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to N N giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring 
 kkr also signaled to the company 's creditors that henry kravis and other kkr directors of sci tv would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and <unk> their voting rights 
 holders of sci tv 's $ N million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to <unk> a lot of debt in exchange for taking a N N equity stake in sci tv 
 they immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems 
 i think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done says analyst craig davis of <unk> smith & co. here 
 investors interpreted the kkr move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of sci tv 
 but a spokesman for kkr says that with only a N N equity stake it would n't be appropriate for kkr to keep board representation 
 kkr already has made about $ N billion of gains from earlier transactions with sci tv thus it is n't significantly affected by the company 's troubles 
 sci tv which is controlled by <unk> tenn. entrepreneur george gillett owns six tv stations including several cbs inc. affiliates 
 it is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in N for a leveraged buy-out 
 through investment banker drexel burnham lambert inc. sci tv is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from N cents to N cents on the dollar 
 kkr would give up a N N equity stake to bondholders while mr. gillett would surrender an N N stake 
 while one big sci tv investor thinks that 's pretty generous many <unk> had been hoping that kkr and mr. gillett would invest new money in sci tv 
 those investors think sci tv needs new equity to survive 
 sci tv 's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $ N million of bank debt 
 it also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due the grace period for paying the bill expires nov. N 
 at the same time investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company 's annual cash interest bill from about $ N million to $ N million 
 yet to pay that interest bill analysts say sci tv will only produce about $ N million to $ N million of cash flow a year

 kemper financial services inc. charging that program trading is <unk> the stock market cut off four big wall street firms from doing any of its <unk> business 
 the move is the biggest <unk> yet in the renewed outcry against program trading with kemper putting its money the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year where its mouth is 
 the kemper corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices such as on tuesday and on oct. N and N and has increased chances for market crashes 
 over the past nine months several firms including discount broker charles schwab & co. and sears roebuck & co. 's dean witter reynolds inc. unit have attacked program trading as a major market evil 
 several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the N crash 
 but most of them led by morgan stanley & co. moved back in earlier this year 
 the most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage the <unk> computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options 
 the object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves 
 index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the new york stock exchange 
 last month program trading accounted for N million shares a day or a record N N of the big board 's average daily volume 
 on tuesday afternoon kemper told bear stearns & co. general electric co. 's kidder peabody & co. unit morgan stanley and oppenheimer & co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage officials inside and outside these firms confirmed 
 kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a <unk> dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be <unk> in the months ahead 
 we 've been opposed to index arbitrage for a long time said stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer at kemper which manages $ N billion including $ N billion of stocks 
 index arbitrage does n't work and it <unk> natural buyers of stock 
 while mr. <unk> explained he 's not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market he said that on an intraday basis it has major effects 
 we 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're <unk> the market 
 they said too bad so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them 
 kemper also <unk> the big board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders 
 the new york stock exchange has vested interests in its big member securities firms that cloud its <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 it has never been interested in what we think 
 the big board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors he added 
 small investors <unk> that big operators dominate the market said thomas <unk> chairman of the national association of investors and head of the exchange 's individual investors advisory committee set up after the N crash 
 the impression i 've got is they 'd love to do away with it program trading but they the exchange ca n't do it he said 
 big board chairman john j. phelan said in a recent interview that he has no <unk> to eliminate program trading 
 he said the market 's volatility <unk> him but that all the exchange can do is slow down the process by using its circuit breakers and shock <unk> 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems 
 morgan stanley and kidder peabody the two biggest program trading firms <unk> defend their strategies 
 we continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable a morgan stanley official said 
 we would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress and we have recently he said citing oct. N and earlier this week 
 michael carpenter president and chief executive officer at kidder peabody said in a recent interview we do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole 
 according to lawrence <unk> a securities industry analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. kemper is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading 
 he added that having just one firm do this is n't going to mean a hill of <unk> 
 but if this <unk> others to consider the same thing then it may become much more important

 at a time when jon levy should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company 's N years his work day is <unk> with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers campeau corp 
 the dress business has always been a gamble but it 's never been like this says mr. levy president of st. <unk> group ltd. which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of <unk> tv commercials 
 every day mr. levy checks orders from campeau department store chains trying to guess if he will be paid 
 i 'm now monitoring every major account 
 campeau owner of such retailers as bloomingdale 's <unk> <unk> and jordan marsh <unk> financial collapse last month after an emergency $ N million loan from olympia & york developments ltd. a canadian developer and a major shareholder in campeau 
 the need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had been told at the company 's annual meeting in july that there were n't any major problems ahead 
 the risk of doing business with campeau 's federated and allied department store chains is about to increase greatly not only for mr. levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers <unk> suppliers trucking firms and fabric houses 
 next week the country 's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing <unk> for spring N the second most important selling season of the year 
 and as the applause dies down in <unk> along seventh avenue and broadway <unk> <unk> campeau buyers will begin writing orders 
 orders from campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration 
 this is no longer true because of campeau 's massive debt load 
 it 's all anybody wants to talk about says richard posner executive vice president for credit exchange inc. a leading credit service 
 people wonder what 's going to happen next 
 many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to campeau stores 
 but those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to campeau stores 
 the few million dollars i could lose today is nothing against what i could lose on the spring line says mr. levy who estimates that campeau stores will sell $ N million worth of his clothes this year 
 i 'm buying fabric right now for clothes which i may not be paid for until april or may 
 what happens to me if campeau <unk> between now and then 
 some credit concerns such as bernard <unk> credit consultants inc. have told clients not to ship anything to federated or allied stores on credit 
 this is especially true for spring merchandise says jim <unk> credit manager at bernard <unk> 
 campeau has too much debt 
 other credit houses such as credit exchange and solo credit service corp. are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping 
 payments are good right now but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit says richard hastings a retail credit analyst referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic 
 the campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze 
 because of those concerns some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise 
 we 're being paid today but we 're worried about tomorrow and will want letters of credit says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified 
 howard <unk> president of the dress firm <unk> b inc. says it 's big time chaos today 
 i 'm going to ship and hope i get paid 
 if i need to ask for money up front later i will 
 carol <unk> vice president corporate communications at campeau says that all of the federated and allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner 
 they continue to pay their bills and will do so says ms. <unk> 
 we 're confident we 'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well 
 typically manufacturers are paid N days after the month in which they ship 
 if goods are shipped to bloomingdale 's between oct. N and oct. N manufacturers expect to be paid by nov. N 
 but manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until march april or even may 
 some in the market question whether campeau will be in a position to pay bills at that time 
 everybody is worried about the possibility of <unk> says kurt <unk> publisher of <unk> 's retail marketing report 
 the buyers who work for the various campeau chains may lose their jobs 
 the stores they work for may be sold 
 what that will mean for manufacturers is anybody 's guess 
 campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ N billion in debt due next spring 
 this includes a working capital facility for allied stores of $ N million that <unk> march N N and an $ N million bridge loan due april N N 
 the company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its march N payments 
 in recent months numerous retailers have filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection including <unk> teller b. altman & co. and miller & <unk> inc 
 those filings plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains such as saks fifth avenue marshall field 's and bloomingdale 's have added to the anxiety 
 right now federated owes us a considerable amount of money says morris <unk> president of david warren enterprises a major dress manufacturer 
 we expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders 
 mr. <unk> adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full 
 it 's become a <unk> business he says 
 business has never been this tough before 
 not only does your product have to be excellent but you also have to be able to collect 
 other manufacturers are equally cautious 
 <unk> <unk> president of <unk> miller inc. says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the federated and allied chains 
 this limits his financial exposure he says 
 the branches are just <unk> over empty halls says mr. <unk> 
 why should i be part of that problem 
 i 've got limited production and i ca n't give it to <unk> 
 campeau 's ms. <unk> disputes mr. <unk> 's comments 
 many of the branches are very lucrative she says 
 that 's just nonsense 
 as for mr. levy at st. <unk> he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various campeau stores unless they miss a payment 
 if they slip for N cents for N minutes i 'll stop he says 
 bethlehem steel corp. <unk> by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and <unk> customers posted a N N drop in third-quarter profit 
 separately two more of the nation 's top steelmakers armco inc. and national intergroup inc. reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry 
 wall street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of N when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines such as rolled sheet used for cars appliances and construction 
 it does n't <unk> well for coming quarters said john jacobson who follows the steel industry for <unk> consultants 
 in fact he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of N 
 bethlehem the nation 's second largest steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 the figures include $ N million in costs related to a blast <unk> <unk> and $ N million in losses from unauthorized work <unk> at the company 's coal operations 
 in the year-ago period bethlehem earned $ N million or $ N a share including a $ N million gain from early retirement of debt 
 third-quarter sales dropped N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year ago 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange bethlehem shares rose N cents to $ N 
 of all the major steelmakers bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown 
 it has n't diversified beyond steel nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks 
 however in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume bethlehem had pretty good earnings numbers said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with salomon brothers inc 
 ms. <unk> had estimated third-quarter earnings of N cents a share but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected 
 still bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ N million from $ N million a year ago when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing 
 the company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market 
 at the same time production costs compared with a year ago were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs which resulted from the company 's new labor pact effective june N 
 we anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories said bethlehem chairman walter f. williams 
 he noted however that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer following the end of labor negotiations 
 armco hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business said third-quarter net income dropped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-ago quarter 
 sales dropped to $ N million from $ N million because the company no longer <unk> its eastern steel division which is now a joint venture with <unk> steel corp 
 along with reduced volume analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding <unk> inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped 
 operating profit dropped N N in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment 
 moreover the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its armco steel co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market higher production costs and a poorer product mix 
 armco shares closed unchanged at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 national intergroup which owns N N of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker national steel corp. posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a net loss of $ N million 
 sales increased in the quarter ended sept. N to $ N million from $ N million a year ago 
 the latest period includes gains of $ N million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward 
 last year 's results were hurt by $ N million in restructuring charges 
 national intergroup stock closed at $ N unchanged in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the company noted that its <unk> drug co. ben franklin stores inc. and <unk> corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves 
 however its equity in the net income of national steel declined to $ N million from $ N million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike 
 national intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its N N interest in national steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations 
 international business machines corp. said it agreed to let motorola inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the u.s. semiconductor industry 
 ibm which made the announcement at the <unk> of a research center here said it invited many other companies to participate as well including some from europe 
 jack <unk> ibm 's president said ibm is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific 
 ibm which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally u.s. industry to head off the japanese who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips 
 while ibm armonk n.y. makes the bulk of the <unk> it uses it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips 
 and ibm worries that the japanese will take over that equipment market too unless u.s. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep u.s. equipment makers healthy 
 failure of u.s. equipment makers ibm fears would leave it dependent on many of the japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market 
 ibm also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing 
 ibm already <unk> in one industrywide effort to improve <unk> techniques 
 ibm said it expects industrywide efforts to become <unk> because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive 
 a <unk> plant cost $ N million in the mid-1970s but costs $ N million today because the technology is so complex 
 and ibm said it expects the costs to continue climbing 
 ibm which said motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the <unk> agreement acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in 
 but it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s 
 ibm said it thought more companies would become interested as the project <unk> 
 the project involving motorola concerns a technique called <unk> <unk> that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips 
 currently chips are produced by <unk> light through a <unk> to produce an image on the chip much as a camera produces an image on film 
 but details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine and the <unk> of even <unk> light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too <unk> much as someone using a wide <unk> could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one 
 <unk> by contrast travel <unk> and can be focused more tightly than light 
 <unk> have problems too 
 they can make the <unk> <unk> and can pass through material they 're not supposed to 
 but assuming those problems can be overcome they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion <unk> of information N times as much as is contained in the <unk> chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s

 comments by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan lent some support to the dollar but the u.s. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies 
 foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on wall street 
 traders said that mr. greenspan whose statements are ordinarily cautious was especially careful to avoid any <unk> <unk> with fears about equities still <unk> financial markets 
 <unk> before a panel of the house banking committee mr. greenspan said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank 
 our essential focus is on domestic policy mr. greenspan said referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy 
 in perhaps his most telling remark mr. greenspan termed the current u.s. inflation rate of around N N as much too high to be ignored 
 he added however that inflation could be brought down close to zero without throwing the economy into a recession 
 analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an indication that the central bank is <unk> to ease monetary policy further in the near future 
 the dollar climbed immediately higher on news of mr. greenspan 's testimony settling lower in later trade as dealers <unk> positions ahead of today 's preliminary report on third-quarter u.s. gross national product

 wall street would like ual corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent 
 but what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and <unk> unions the pilots and machinists 
 some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ N billion buy-out if anything may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups 
 as a result both may now have <unk> veto power over any ual transaction 
 one reason banks likely to react to any new ual deal with even more caution than the first time around probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a <unk> recapitalization plan 
 united pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike said an executive at fuji bank one of ual 's large lenders 
 if you have both labor groups on strike you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at 
 just this past week a leading japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible 
 another reason <unk> by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs 
 the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts 
 that gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work 
 thus even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key 
 there 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions said richard nye of baker nye investments a new york takeover <unk> 
 mr. nye thinks the ual board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value 
 both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like 
 the pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here pilot union chairman frederick c. <unk> declared yesterday 
 but whether the pilots can team up with their longtime <unk> the machinists is another question 
 the pilots ' mr. <unk> says his union would like majority ownership for employees 
 at the very least the pilots want some form of control over the airline perhaps through <unk> voting rights 
 on the other hand the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle saying they do n't think employees should be owners 
 still in recent days machinists ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility 
 we may be able to reach a <unk> where we can accommodate the pilot union 's concerns and <unk> said brian m. freeman the machinists ' financial adviser 
 mr. freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders an employee stake and perhaps an equity investment by a friendly investor 
 if a compromise ca n't be reached the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists 
 but at this point that may just be <unk> thinking 
 the machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from ual pilots and management for the company 
 their opposition helped scare off some japanese banks 
 the pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve 
 who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union asks <unk> <unk> an analyst at wertheim <unk> & co 
 who would the board be working for the public shareholders or the pilots she adds 
 ms. <unk> says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots <unk> on their demand for control 
 she also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now they still could come back at a later time and try to take control 
 another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the <unk> of the board through the solicitation of <unk> 
 in that way the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal 
 the group did n't make a formal offer but instead told ual 's advisers before the <unk> board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ N and $ N a share 
 but again they may need the help of the machinists 
 i think the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen said one official familiar with the situation 
 the board and ual 's management he says ca n't go back to business as usual 
 the pilots wo n't let them 
 delta air lines earnings soared N N to a record in the fiscal first quarter <unk> the industry trend toward declining profits 
 the atlanta-based airline the third largest in the u.s. attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic new international routes and reduced service by rival eastern airlines which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring

 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 during the quarter delta issued N million shares of common stock to <unk> and <unk> N million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan 
 the key to delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth said thomas <unk> chief financial officer 
 passenger traffic jumped N N in the quarter while profit per passenger grew N N 
 delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of eastern airlines which shares the atlanta hub 
 although eastern is back to about N N of its <unk> schedule now the texas air corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter

 columbia savings & loan association reeling from <unk> changes mandated by congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market announced a loss for the third quarter of $ N million or $ N a share 
 for the quarter a year ago columbia reported earnings of $ N million or N cents a share 
 total assets increased to $ N billion in the latest quarter from $ N billion a year earlier 
 the loss stems from $ N million of write-downs on columbia 's $ N billion high-yield investment securities portfolio which includes about $ N billion of junk bonds $ N million of preferred stock and treasury securities 
 columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio the largest of any u.s. thrift 
 much of columbia 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its beverly hills neighbor drexel burnham lambert inc 
 for the nine months losses totaled $ N million or $ N a share compared with net income of $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 the results include a $ N million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value 
 columbia also added $ N million to reserves for losses on the portfolio increasing general reserves to $ N million or about N N of the total portfolio as of sept. N 
 on june N loss reserves stood at $ N million 
 thrift officials said the $ N million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of <unk> and market conditions 
 the adjustments result from the recently passed <unk> bailout legislation which requires thrifts to <unk> all high-yield bond investments by N 
 previously columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices because it held the bonds as long-term investments 
 because columbia now must sell the bonds within five years accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices 
 for its future strategy columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments as well as <unk> up more traditional thrift activities 
 the quarterly results also reflected $ N million in <unk> losses from commercial real-estate activities in california 
 thomas spiegel columbia 's chairman said in a statement that the thrift was disappointed by the effects of the accounting changes 
 but he said columbia remains one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital 
 columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market 
 its shares closed at $ N each in composite new york stock exchange trading down N cents 
 the price of columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since august when they traded at about $ N as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down 
 the stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks from a price of $ N a share on oct. N 
 columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will <unk> of the thrift 's junk bonds because federal regulations such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries have n't yet been completed 
 columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements despite the large reserves and write-downs and <unk> regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end 
 its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of sept. N was N N and total equity was $ N million 
 the thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs which has a book value of $ N million 
 although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ N million to $ N million 
 columbia also has <unk> gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ N million

 <unk> cos. said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands setting the stage for a potentially <unk> price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow 
 anheuser the world 's largest brewer and u.s. market leader has historically been reluctant to engage in <unk> as a means of boosting sales volume 
 with the passing of the <unk> days of swelling industry sales however the <unk> and brief <unk> into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry 
 over the summer anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time 
 some experts now predict anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players 
 the st. louis company said major rivals philip morris co. 's miller brewing unit and <unk> coors co. have been following a policy of <unk> and deep discounting for at least the past N months on their premium brands pricing their product as much as N cents a <unk> below anheuser 's <unk> label in many markets 
 anheuser said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a <unk> basis 
 <unk> announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a <unk> N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents 
 <unk> sales were $ N billion up from last year 's $ N billion 
 anheuser said its new strategy started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide will mean <unk> earnings for the last half of N and for N 
 the projection sent anheuser shares plunging $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 the stock closed at $ N on heavy volume of about N million shares 
 shares of coors the company 's sole publicly traded major competitor fell $ N apiece to $ N in national over-the-counter trading apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle 
 anheuser noted that beer industry sales volume is N is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s with sales volume being essentially flat while consolidation creates fewer bigger players 
 we can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend anheuser said adding it will take appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy for the premium brands 
 anheuser said it continues to hold to its <unk> goal of a N N u.s. market share by the mid-1990s 
 beneath the <unk> <unk> <unk> lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant which last year accounted for about N N of all u.s. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to N N in the current year 
 anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar and he just decided to join in the <unk> <unk> said joseph j. doyle an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co 
 it 's going to get bloody 
 jerry <unk> publisher of beer marketers <unk> a trade newsletter said anheuser 's announcement means everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives 
 prudential-bache securities inc. analyst george e. thompson <unk> the importance of the announcement and called any comparison between the coming <unk> <unk> and the seemingly <unk> <unk> wars unwarranted 
 mr. thompson calls discounting a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share and projected that anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on <unk> or face a costly and <unk> battle 
 mr. thompson noted that the disappointing earnings which fell five cents a share short of his own projections contributed to the sell-off by an <unk> and currently <unk> investing public 
 but smith barney 's mr. doyle who yesterday trimmed his N anheuser earnings projection to $ N a share from $ N called the market 's reaction justified 
 while the third-quarter earnings were a moderate disappointment he said the real bad news is the intensity of price competition in the <unk> sector 
 according to mr. <unk> the newsletter publisher anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its <unk> competitor miller brewing which had a N N stake last year 
 it 's followed by <unk> brewery co. which has agreed to sell its assets to coors 
 both coors and <unk> have recently been <unk> market share to miller and anheuser

 the <unk> house by a margin of N votes failed to override president bush 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest 
 the N roll call illustrates the limits of power a <unk> abortion-rights movement still faces 
 it continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over mr. bush 
 democrats voted to override by a N margin but republicans were equally firm in support of the president who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal N spending bills 
 yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills an estimated $ N billion measure funding the departments of labor education and health and human services 
 to gain more leverage abortion-rights advocates may seek to <unk> the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month 
 but the stark numbers yesterday when N votes were needed indicate the president is in a commanding position for at least this year 
 unless he changes they lose said a democratic leadership aide 
 the action came as congress sent to the president last night a <unk> spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake 
 by a <unk> N margin the senate approved the measure after <unk> further provisions sought by the influential california delegation and despite reservations the house adopted the bill on a N roll call 
 the package is more than $ N billion above the recommendations of budget director richard darman this week 
 but given the political importance of california the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any senate amendments adding further new appropriations 
 the $ N billion measure comes on top of $ N billion appropriated after hugo struck the carolinas and caribbean last month and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of <unk> disaster loans 
 the bill last night includes $ N million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the small business administration <unk> to $ N billion to accommodate the expected loan activity 
 in direct cash assistance $ N billion is provided in federal highway construction funds and $ N billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters 
 in the senate majority whip alan cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the house had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months 
 the emergency assistance would n't be counted against a state 's normal allocation of annual highway funds and the bill <unk> existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road such as the san <unk> bay bridge damaged in last week 's earthquake 
 the underlying <unk> bill is the second required by congress this fall and since the current fiscal year began oct. N only the energy and interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law 
 the <unk> over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and apart from the health and education measure vetoed by mr. bush bills funding the district of columbia and the entire u.s. <unk> budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or <unk> issues 
 the vote yesterday was the most <unk> in many years and though the democratic leadership is <unk> about how to address the abortion issue the debate is increasingly measured in party terms 
 the N democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with N who initially backed the <unk> exemption two weeks ago and N last year on a similar vote 
 by comparison republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement 
 only N gop members opposed the president 's veto a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just N more than the N who supported the <unk> exemption last year

 this is n't a political issue this is a moral issue said rep. henry <unk> r. ill. the most <unk> spokesman for the anti-abortion movement 
 but after years of using the issue for its benefit the gop finds its candidates on the defensive 
 new jersey gubernatorial candidate rep. james florio <unk> returned from <unk> to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent gop rep. james courter who has <unk> supported abortion restrictions in the past but was <unk>

 the new york stock exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today just as controversy over this trading strategy <unk> up 
 the big board this morning plans to begin trading its exchange stock portfolio basket product the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval 
 <unk> will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all N stocks in standard & poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ N million 
 <unk> baskets of fewer stocks will also be available 
 the securities and exchange commission gave provisional six-month approval to the big board basket at a meeting late yesterday 
 the sec at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the chicago board options exchange where the minimum will be $ N million 
 also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the midwest stock exchange 
 the basket products are an <unk> step in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the N market crash said sec commissioner joseph <unk> 
 new sec chairman richard breeden overseeing his first public meeting said there have been concerns that the big board 's basket could attract investors with a short-term perspective who would rapidly turn over the product thus increasing volatility 
 but richard <unk> the sec 's market regulation chief said he did n't believe this will <unk> dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be <unk> 
 the baskets on the big board and cboe which involve the actual s&p stocks unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the chicago futures markets and index options on the cboe will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings 
 the big board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from <unk> forms of program trading 
 <unk> are also an attempt by the big board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as london 
 big board officials also hope japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product 
 already many of the big board 's own floor traders are warning that the <unk> baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public 
 the <unk> alliance of floor brokers said the new product with the $ N million minimum will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to wild <unk> of volatility 
 stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the big board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading which last month accounted for a record N N of the exchange 's average daily volume 
 the new york stock exchange is losing its cool here said james <unk> head of institutional trading at <unk> montgomery scott inc. in philadelphia 
 the new stock baskets are going to make it easier for program trading to be done 
 and it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places 
 both the big board 's exchange stock portfolio and the chicago exchange 's market basket are designed for institutional investors 
 the big board lists its targets as pension plans mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders 
 in index arbitrage program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets 
 at the same time only four securities firms have signed up with the big board to buy and sell <unk> as market makers an <unk> response 
 the market makers so far are cs first boston group 's first boston corp. unit morgan stanley & co. painewebber group inc. and salomon inc. 's salomon brothers inc. unit 
 kidder peabody & co. a general electric co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with morgan stanley is n't a market maker although the big board hopes that will change 
 similarly the big board hopes to <unk> merrill lynch & co 
 neither has plans to be a market maker for now 
 traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading 
 big board officials say only N contracts a day may trade at first equivalent to a day 's action at a small regional exchange 
 even though the big board says its product represents a post-crash reform some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's friday the 13th market plunge the dow jones industrial average might have dropped more than the N points it did 
 with the futures locked into a trading halt oct. N and trading in some individual stock difficult program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system the traders say

 comprehensive care said first hospital had advised it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition although it is n't assured the acquisition will be completed 
 if it is n't completed comprehensive care said it would be required to promptly restructure its debt 
 first hospital advised comprehensive care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at comprehensive care by the end of october 
 failure to win such a determination however would lead comprehensive care directors to consider various alternatives comprehensive care said without <unk> 
 separately first hospital reported a N N rise in net income to $ N million for its year ended june N on a N N increase in revenue to $ N million 
 it said however that net income for the <unk> period ended aug. N plunged to $ N from $ N in the prior year on a N N rise in revenue to $ N million

 after coming close to a partial settlement a year ago shareholders who filed civil suits against ivan f. boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord people familiar with the case said 
 meanwhile within the next few weeks the limited partners in ivan f. boesky & co l.p. are expected to reach a partial settlement with drexel burnham lambert inc. regarding the distribution of the $ N million in partnership assets said one of the individuals 
 under the terms of the settlement the limited partners would drop their civil suits against drexel now pending in federal court in new york another individual said 
 attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago when reports of an imminent agreement circulated 
 one individual said the shareholders ' accord was well worked out 
 however less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the <unk> of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with <unk> claims there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart 
 a shareholders ' accord would provide the first <unk> to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by boesky & co. once the largest arbitrage fund in the u.s. 
 the plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which mr. boesky and his partnerships were dealing 
 some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling 
 stocks involved in the shareholder suits include union carbide rjr nabisco american natural resources <unk> cascade corp. general foods corp. houston natural gas and <unk> corp 
 there are at least N class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in new york under u.s. district judge milton <unk> 
 among the defendants are mr. boesky the <unk> ivan f. boesky & co. mr. boesky 's main underwriter drexel burnham and <unk> & general securities plc a british investment fund once controlled by mr. boesky 
 individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the boesky partnership the british fund and mr. boesky as defendants while drexel and other defendants would remain 
 charles <unk> of the washington <unk> law firm <unk> cutler & <unk> which represents mr. boesky in this matter said only that discussions are under way 
 there are no agreements yet 
 it has been three years since mr. boesky now in prison agreed to pay a $ N million fine to settle the government 's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information 
 out of this the government set up a $ N million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses 
 according to william <unk> an attorney at <unk> & <unk> the escrow agents for the fund as of sept. N the fund amounted to $ N million 
 separately attorneys for the N or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership 's assets 
 the limited partners include insurance companies financial institutions and individual investors 
 an agreement with drexel regarding the limited partners ' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back 
 this is because a delaware court earlier this year said that drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners 
 drexel is owed $ N million by the partnership 
 an individual familiar with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited partners do not recoup from the $ N million in partnership assets they will receive from the $ N million <unk> fund available as a result of drexel 's settlement with the government in december N 
 drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $ N million of which $ N million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs including the limited partners who claim they were injured by drexel 
 jailed <unk> activist wins a battle against the 
 u.s. district judge robert p. patterson jr. ordered the fbi to immediately begin processing <unk> benjamin ferguson 's request for documents stemming from the agency 's investigation of him during the 1960s 
 the fbi had said it would not be able to begin processing the request until june 
 mr. ferguson who is N years old fled the u.s. in N after <unk> his appeals of a N conviction on conspiracy to murder 
 he turned himself in to authorities in new york earlier this year 
 he maintains that the information from the fbi will help him get his N conviction vacated and his <unk> indictment dismissed 
 his attorneys claim he was <unk> by the fbi and new york police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s 
 because the federal freedom of information act was n't law at that time the fbi was n't required to turn over information on its investigations when mr. ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s 
 but in federal court in manhattan judge patterson said the fbi records could show that mr. ferguson 's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices 
 the judge said that if the fbi 's proposed schedule was followed in <unk> the documents a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his N 1\/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files

 federal courts urged to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits 
 the study conducted by a task force of the <unk> institution suggests that congress should require the courts to develop the plans 
 the study was initiated by senate judiciary committee chairman joseph <unk> d. del 
 the washington d.c. think tank recommends that the courts adopt different tracks for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones 
 complex cases such as antitrust suits and many business disputes would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving 
 standard cases would require less judicial attention and <unk> cases could be resolved quickly 
 the study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence ranging from as much as N days for cases in the fast track to as much as N months for complex disputes 
 and the study said federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process 
 to take advantage of local expertise and custom the study said congress should require each of the N federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases 
 although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse adding significance to the effort

 that level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong analysts said

 grains and soybeans 
 soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends as well as continued export strength 
 a <unk> off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices 
 wheat futures prices fell however at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million <unk> of wheat by commodity <unk> richard dennis 
 neither mr. dennis nor officials of his chicago trading company <unk> commodities could be reached for comment 
 as for corn and soybean futures a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying supported prices in early trading said steven freed a futures analyst with dean witter reynolds inc. in chicago 
 soybean futures for november delivery gained N cents a bushel to close at $ N a bushel on the chicago board of trade

 cotton 
 futures prices rose modestly but trading volume was n't very heavy 
 the december contract settled at N cents a pound up N cent but it rose as high as N cents 
 several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical 
 traders who had sold contracts earlier in hopes of buying them back at lower prices yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses 
 floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors which have been circulating for the past two days about china purchasing cotton 
 the rumor which has been neither confirmed nor denied has china buying N to N <unk> for near-term delivery 
 one floor trader said that if there were chinese purchases they should have had a bigger effect on the market 
 another said that if china was a buyer it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the N crop year and thus would be a bullish sign 
 this trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the <unk> who see higher prices ahead and the technicians who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range around N cents and selling it when the price <unk> more than N cents 
 this trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the december contract was able to exceed N cents 
 he also noted that stocks on aug. N N are currently projected at N million <unk> the smallest <unk> supply since N 
 cocoa 
 the modest sell-off which started on tuesday continued 
 the december contract ended at $ N a metric ton down $ N 
 the market is <unk> at least partly because of a lack of crop information out of <unk> and the ivory coast the two largest african producers 
 harry schwartz a soft commodity specialist for <unk> investors services in new york said the only report <unk> has issued about the <unk> of cocoa from the interior was for N metric tons as of oct. N 
 by this time last year he noted <unk> totaling N tons had been announced 
 a similar situation apparently exists in the ivory coast with no figures released yet this year compared with N tons as of this time a year ago 
 he said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports shipping delays could result 
 this is the worry that probably brought <unk> to the market earlier in the week he said 
 there was also some fear that without ivory coast cocoa a large french cocoa merchant cie financiere <unk> <unk> <unk> might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for december delivery in london 
 however the french merchant has about N tons of old crop ivory coast cocoa <unk> in the netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the ivory coast last spring

 japan is going on a <unk> binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink 
 its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row and its <unk> producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity modernize factories and develop new products 
 the boom 's so huge says <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> research institute it makes you think of the golden <unk> when japan developed rapidly 
 the more factories and robots japanese manufacturers add the more they will be able to export and the less their domestic customers will need to import 
 at <unk> inc. for example sales are up nearly N N this year so the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any japanese company would do under the circumstances it is increasing capital spending by N N 
 it is building among other things a new <unk> factory in western japan that can produce up to N printers next year 
 some N N of them are to be exported to the u.s. 
 even companies in <unk> industries <unk> with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom 
 japan 's steelmakers are raising capital spending N N this year to $ N billion 
 hitachi <unk> corp. a <unk> buried in debt just a few years ago will build a machinery plant its first expansion in N years 
 so big is the <unk> boom that japanese companies ' outlays in japan topped american companies ' domestic outlays by $ N billion to $ N billion in the N months ended march N even though japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds america 's 
 from a financial standpoint the boom could n't come at a better time 
 many japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year and japanese interest rates though up a bit recently are still low 
 and in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends companies can <unk> their profits back into plant and equipment 
 but some economists and government officials here are n't <unk> 
 they fear that the boom may be too big for japan 's or anyone else 's good 
 it 's an explosive <unk> thrown at the world says kenneth <unk> senior economist at the tokyo unit of deutsche bank group 
 the ministry of international trade and industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending 
 <unk> officials hope to avoid <unk> source of trade <unk> with the u.s. even though export restraints currently limit japanese car exports to the u.s. 
 not everyone is worried however 
 some economists and many japanese companies are <unk> by the warnings 
 the investment boom is mainly sparked they say by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply 
 moreover much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity 
 according to a survey of some N large companies by the japan development bank expanded capacity is the goal of just N N of the outlays for manufacturers alone the figure is N N 
 the manufacturers said N N of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones N N is to cut costs N N is for research and development and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes 
 but the <unk> remain <unk> 
 with japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world they think that japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more 
 and eventually they contend domestic demand will weaken forcing companies to <unk> exports again 
 if there 's a further drive to export says <unk> <unk> an economist at the japan development bank that 'll be a problem 
 even in the short run the investment boom could <unk> a disturbing trend japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease 
 japanese auto makers for example are increasing their production capacity in the u.s. the additional production should in part replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones 
 but although japanese companies increased their u.s. auto output by N N from january to september compared with the year-earlier period their exports to the u.s. will drop only N N this year nikko research center estimates 
 in contrast to previous economic <unk> japanese auto companies are n't just trying to boost production 
 many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and to some extent to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from south korea and taiwan 
 others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once 
 so many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that <unk> ltd. a robot maker also had to build a new plant 
 the buildup is making japan clearly more efficient more <unk> advanced and more competitive declares a western diplomat in tokyo 
 but whatever its effects on exports and imports japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been <unk> at least partly by soaring domestic demand 
 japan 's marathon economy growing at N N this year is now in its <unk> month of expansion and some economists are betting that the boom will <unk> the record <unk> expansion in the late 1960s 
 japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money especially on high-priced goods such as <unk> television sets and luxury cars 
 nissan motor co. 's domestic auto sales are up N N this year largely because its expensive <unk> <unk> and <unk> models are in heavy demand 
 one dealer told me that if he had more cars he 'd sell them right away says <unk> <unk> nissan executive vice president 
 he adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand by <unk> its employees 
 similarly honda motor co. 's sales are so brisk that workers <unk> they have n't had a saturday off in years despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity 
 with demand growing and workers in short supply many japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on <unk> 
 among them are the <unk> which had <unk> their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are <unk> an increased share of the strengthening global market 
 <unk> heavy industries co. a medium-sized <unk> expects its sales to increase N N this year largely because of rising demand for oil <unk> 
 once one japanese company steps up its investments the whole industry follows 
 because most businesses put market share above profitability to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go <unk> is to concede defeat 
 the emphasis on market share is evident at daikin industries ltd. japan 's biggest maker of industrial air <unk> 
 seeing new office buildings <unk> up and its sales soar daikin is building another plant which will lift its production capacity N N 
 the expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to N N from N N currently 
 besides daikin 's major competitors hitachi ltd. and mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. are all adding production lines a daikin spokesman says 
 until now we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had 
 but we ca n't produce enough anymore 
 the competition is even more <unk> in the auto industry where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market 
 nissan aims to expand its N N share of the market to N N by spending $ N million on a plant in southern japan that could make as many as N cars a year 
 meanwhile toyota motor corp. 's $ N million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by N cars and honda is spending $ N million on expansion 
 mazda motor corp. is still considering its options but it <unk> aims to double its annual domestic sales to N cars in the next four years 
 those who are n't worried about how japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't <unk> for imports 
 although imports account for less than N N of beer sales in japan <unk> <unk> ltd. which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer plans to fend off japanese competitors by pouring $ N billion into facilities to <unk> N N more beer 
 but <unk> development will make japanese companies stronger and big investments in domestic industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the japanese market 
 moreover much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which japanese companies have only limited foreign competition so more investment practically <unk> more exports 
 toshiba corp. for example is spending $ N million on two new plants to build <unk> dynamic random access memories the next generation of computer chips 
 the product is n't widely used yet but toshiba which has already beaten everyone else in producing the <unk> <unk> <unk> believes that its early investment will <unk> its chances of beating its competitors again 
 it 's important to gain leadership a toshiba spokesman says 
 meanwhile toshiba 's japanese rivals hitachi fujitsu ltd. and nec corp. are n't sitting still 
 after doubling production in one plant nec is spending $ N million to build another plant that in two years will be able to make a million <unk> <unk> a year 
 the new chip plants wo n't be excessive investment says <unk> <unk> an nec vice president 
 we have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products 
 some of japan 's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas 
 toyota 's $ N lexus automobile a luxury model that it started shipping to the u.s. only last month is <unk> up orders at a time when <unk> luxury-car sales are slow 
 toyota plans to raise lexus exports when a new plant starts up next year

 japanese companies have a <unk> competitor attitude 
 if excess capacity develops they say not everyone will suffer 
 the losers will be those with the least attractive products and many of them analysts think will be foreign companies

 <unk> 's results were somewhat worse than expected 
 jay stevens an analyst with dean witter reynolds said he expected the sunnyvale calif. company to earn N cents a share for the quarter and said the firm 's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from international business machines corp. <unk> 's principal competitor for mainframe sales

 the clearance by the food and drug administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of aids to the only <unk> drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease 
 the drug will be given treatment <unk> new drug status a label <unk> to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval 
 the move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection 
 adults with aids have had access to azt since fda approved the drug 's usage for adults in march N 
 but despite more than two years of research showing azt can relieve <unk> and other symptoms in children the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients 
 as a result many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and for the few exceptions insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ N a year 
 so far aids has <unk> N children under age N with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms 
 to date N of those children have died according to the federal centers for disease control

 i could get azt says mrs. <unk> who bears her infection without any symptoms 
 but my daughter could n't until she was too ill to take it 
 to watch your child die is an <unk> experience 
 her son healthy and <unk> currently takes no medication 
 the delay in getting azt to children has been blamed on a combination of factors 
 traditionally the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult <unk> for pediatric uses because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape 
 <unk> critics have charged azt 's maker <unk> wellcome co. with corporate <unk> because children account for just N N of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market 
 wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to <unk> the relevant data and recently promised to develop a pediatric <unk> form easier for youngsters to take 
 still all this comes nearly a year and a half after philip <unk> of the national cancer institute offered evidence that azt could reverse the <unk> of aids <unk> sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of <unk> levels and <unk> of lost motor skills 
 since then roughly N pediatric patients have received the drug in his program 
 to some mothers the expected fda action is a <unk> reminder of what might have been 
 my first reaction is i do n't understand why it 's taken so long

 mrs. <unk> who is a <unk> of the pediatric aids foundation based in santa <unk> calif. <unk> neither bureaucratic nor corporate <unk> 
 there 's no finger to be pointed she said 
 the crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well and to make sure other experimental drugs like bristol-myers co. 's <unk> do n't follow the same frustrating course as azt 
 aids <unk> which gradually <unk> children 's ability to speak walk and think is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome

 a spokesman for mccaw said the company was moving forward with our financing 
 he added that hopefully lin will conduct a fair auction 
 mccaw wants to buy N million shares of lin for $ N each or $ N billion which would result in mccaw 's owning N N of lin 
 the offer is in limbo however because lin has agreed to merge its <unk> businesses with bellsouth corp

 spiegel inc. citing continuing improvement in the apparel market said third-quarter net income jumped N N from the soft year-earlier period on an N N increase in revenue 
 the catalog retailer reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share up sharply from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 revenue rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 spiegel said margins improved because its inventory position this year did n't need the costly <unk> required to trim last year 's <unk> levels

 the bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that tw services a group of restaurant chains became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers 
 the good news to fans of stable credit at least is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers 
 apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk 
 coniston partners which with related entities controls N N of tw had been planning to sell $ N billion of junk bonds among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares 
 but coniston a new york partnership managed by the firm of <unk> <unk> & oliver yesterday announced that in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets the offering would be postponed and restructured 
 what was n't mentioned is that coniston and its investment banker donaldson lufkin & jenrette just completed a <unk> road show for the purpose of marketing the bonds 
 and investors at least for now took a pass 
 tw 's junk bonds were n't as junk bonds go unusually weak 
 its fast-food restaurants including <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> 's and el <unk> <unk> the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in <unk> chicken are stable <unk> and growing 
 but unless they continued to grow tw based in <unk> n.j. would have run into trouble 
 until recently such <unk> <unk> deals were routine 
 but people do n't buy anything on expectation anymore says jack <unk> who manages the high-yield fund of <unk> financial services 
 investors he adds are getting <unk> 
 the tw buy-out may yet be financed 
 there is nothing wrong with the company says coniston principal paul <unk> 
 the <unk> he says is that the junk market is n't as deep as before 
 tw 's <unk> meeting was postponed from tomorrow to nov. N 
 by then dlj hopes to be able to sell <unk> junk bonds 
 <unk> <unk> & oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ N million in equity it had planned on 
 banks may contribute more senior debt 
 and the total amount of junk financing will be reduced 
 a dlj banker putting a best possible face on it asserts that very few people said they did n't like the credit quality 
 people said they did n't think a billion-dollar deal would trade 
 but trading risk stems from credit risk 
 and by adding equity dlj would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern 
 indeed the dlj banker says in the <unk> capital structure cash coverage of interest will <unk> improve 
 as he sums it up we are listening to the market 
 what is it to borrow a term from coniston that so unsettled the market 
 some of the same risks that were cited and seemingly ignored in dozens of previous junk offerings 
 the tw prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier pretax earnings would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges including interest on debt securities by approximately $ N million in the first six months of N 
 tw notes as many junk issuers do that adjusted to eliminate <unk> charges tw would have run a cash surplus in this case of $ N million over six months 
 but such calculations ignore the <unk> charge of depreciation taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french <unk> deterioration of stores and the like 
 in fact dlj says the company <unk> capital expenses of about $ N million a year 
 tw 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn 
 but they wo n't necessarily eat at <unk> 's 
 the fast-food business is intensely competitive notes wertheim schroder analyst john <unk> 
 prospective bond buyers noted that tw historically has <unk> because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and <unk> <unk> 
 we were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt says a big investor in high-yield debt 
 dlj argues that tw could if necessary cut capital spending since half of what it plans to spend is for growth rather than maintenance 
 but investors noted that under the <unk> offering tw would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments 
 its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ N million a year in interest on <unk> or zero-coupon debentures which ultimately would have had to be paid 
 the prospectus notes there can be no assurance that future growth will continue at past levels 
 in the recent past bond buyers did n't seek such assurance 
 now apparently they do

 one day last march cbs sports president neal pilson and olympics <unk> barry frank met for lunch at the <unk> club here 
 mr. frank told mr. pilson that olympics officials wanted $ N million or more for tv rights to the N winter games in norway 
 the cbs official said that price sounded fine 
 at that price cbs was the only player at the table when negotiations with the international olympic committee started in toronto aug. N 
 dick pound a committee member began by disclosing that abc and nbc had refused to even bid 
 then he asked mr. pilson to raise his offer anyway if we can have a number that starts with a three you can have a <unk> 
 mr. pilson and his team <unk> in a <unk> and took just N minutes to return with a $ N million offer 
 mr. pound responded it 's a deal 
 a <unk> mr. pilson announced his <unk> coup at a news conference that afternoon 
 mr. pilson 's rivals at abc and nbc <unk> at the price 
 how could cbs get pushed into <unk> itself 
 well cbs mired in the ratings <unk> and looking to sports as a way out wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid 
 but mr. pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid 
 the price of <unk> has gone up <unk> charles m. <unk> the college football association 's executive director 
 with cbs inc. on a spending spree that may top $ N billion for four years of major sports events the new <unk> of <unk> could jolt the entire broadcast business 
 cbs itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong 
 abc a unit of capital cities\/abc inc. and general electric co. 's national broadcasting co. also risk losses if they <unk> cbs for other contracts 
 while rights fees head <unk> ad rates wo n't 
 advertisers already are <unk> at higher prices 
 the networks are paying too much for rights warns <unk> paul <unk> of young & rubicam 
 if they ask advertisers to absorb the costs they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports above all 
 viewers may not be <unk> either 
 soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials 
 at the same time some sports events will move off free television and onto cable or <unk> where half the nation 's tv homes ca n't see them 
 cbs has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids that is can the network alone make a profit on it 
 mr. pilson <unk> the <unk> benefits of positive press <unk> affiliate stations enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other cbs programs when the game is over 
 the billion-dollar question is how much are those benefits worth 
 some tv people doubt they will <unk> and argue that even if they do they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that cbs could run up 
 as we 've seen in the '80s says roger werner the president of the espn sports channel those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work 
 and three years later in a sea of red ink the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do 
 cbs <unk> top sports to <unk> the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates viewers and advertisers charges thomas h. <unk> who was ousted as chairman of cbs inc. after laurence a. tisch bought a N N stake in the company and took over three years ago 
 they lost the entertainment crown and they needed one 
 and they 've bought one 
 on just three big deals for four years of baseball and for the olympic winter games in both N and N pilson bid a total of $ N billion 
 that 's well over half a billion dollars more than abc and nbc were willing to pay 
 after N the winter and summer olympics will be held two years apart with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in N and the summer games in N 
 now mr. pilson a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs a level of focus and intellectual attention similar to a good <unk> is facing the consequences of his own <unk> 
 next month talks will begin on two <unk> cbs contracts for the pro and college basketball <unk> 
 cbs is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them 
 the potential bill more than $ N million for several seasons an N N jump 
 a few months later cbs 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal they could go for close to $ N million more than cbs now pays a N N to N N rise 
 what happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports says peter <unk> a former cbs sports president now at <unk> inc 
 j. william <unk> former president of espn says nbc may come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from cbs and say we can <unk> too 
 and the winners will be the colleges not either network 
 nor by the way advertisers 
 mr. pilson is an unlikely big <unk> 
 in the mid-1980s after abc had just bid a record $ N million for the N winter games he <unk> at rivals for paying reckless prices 
 i love pilson but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and <unk> says robert <unk> a former cbs sports president 
 and yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today 
 rivals <unk> at the principle of pilson as nbc 's arthur watson once put it he 's always <unk> that rights are too high then he 's going crazy 
 but the <unk> mr. pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers 
 a yale law school graduate he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metromedia inc. and the william morris talent agency 
 in N he joined cbs sports to head business affairs and five years later became its president 
 mr. pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago i did n't say forever and i did n't say every property 
 the market changed he adds 
 and he is n't the only big <unk> nbc will pay a record $ N million for the N summer games and espn <unk> by capital cities\/abc will shell out $ N million for four years of baseball airing N regular-season games a year 
 our competitors say we <unk> them 
 who <unk> 
 maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't mr. pilson says 
 mr. pilson 's major events strategy <unk> after mr. tisch took over 
 mr. pilson recalls that in april N after cbs 's annual meeting in philadelphia he and mr. tisch took the <unk> train ride back to new york and mr. pilson used this extended private audience to <unk> his ambitions 
 mr. tisch a billionaire in hotels and finance was just learning the tv business 
 five months later mr. tisch took over as cbs 's chief executive and soon he was <unk> sole approval each time mr. pilson <unk> a <unk> large figure on a slip of paper <unk> it in an <unk> and gave it to sports negotiators 
 then in may N mr. tisch <unk> needed to make a bold statement to <unk> rumors that he might sell the network 
 mr. pilson gave him one he bid $ N million for rights to the N winter games in <unk> france abc and nbc would n't bid even $ N million 
 that started the <unk> bidding wars 
 the major events strategy mr. pilson says is designed to <unk> a place for cbs on the crowded tv dial of the 1990s 
 it 's also a fast fix for an ailing image 
 he sees flashy sports as the only way the <unk> network can cut through the clutter of cable and <unk> grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows <unk> a few weeks later 
 next october cbs for the first time wo n't have to start the season against the <unk> american and national baseball league <unk> and the world series 
 i 've been struggling against that for years says jonathan <unk> who runs <unk> the <unk> station in chicago 
 even if baseball <unk> losses at cbs and he does n't think it will i 'd rather see the games on our air than on nbc and abc he says 
 that is n't surprising 
 regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past five years and <unk> new shows is a <unk> shoot mr. pilson says 
 but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences N N or N N larger than those cbs usually gets 
 mr. pilson says baseball and the olympics may help cbs move up to no. N in the household ratings race putting <unk> back into the network 's image 
 and the winter olympics will air during the february <unk> when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations 
 that will please <unk> affiliates another aim of the pilson plan 
 they <unk> await the dream season in N 
 cbs will air the <unk> bowl baseball playoffs college and pro basketball <unk> and other premier sports events 
 it 's made me more committed to cbs says philip a. jones the president of meredith corp. 's broadcast group which has two cbs affiliates 
 the cbs plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success however 
 no amount of <unk> will bring viewers back if the shows are weak 
 in this market of N channels sophisticated viewers and the <unk> control trial is n't a guarantee of anything espn 's mr. werner says 
 if the show ai n't a killer they 're gone 
 during the N summer games for example abc touted call to glory but the military drama was missing in action within weeks 
 last october during the N summer games nbc <unk> pitched a new series <unk> 
 it <unk> anyway 
 moreover sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women 
 though cbs might move up to no. N in household ratings most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged N to N 
 cbs may remain a distant no. N in that regard 
 nor is cbs a <unk> to get blockbuster ratings 
 in recent years the world series and the olympics were aired against cbs 's <unk> lineup 
 but cbs will put the athletes up against bill cosby <unk> and other shows in nbc 's no. N schedule 
 even the <unk> to affiliate relations may be limited 
 the sports lineup may add only N N to N N to a station 's annual profits 
 it alone is n't likely to stop a station from <unk> cbs shows 
 the world series seven nights was n't enough of an incentive says arnold <unk> of <unk> in rochester which dropped cbs for nbc six weeks ago 
 you 've got to judge where the network will be in three years 
 the <unk> benefits may prove extremely costly if cbs ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself 
 and avoiding such losses will take a <unk> effort 
 on the $ N billion baseball agreement alone cbs is likely to lose $ N million in four years contends mr. <unk> the former cbs man now at comsat inc 
 nevertheless he <unk> the deal plain smart for its huge promotional value 
 mr. pilson calls that loss estimate wildly inaccurate <unk> only that cbs will lose money on baseball in the first year 
 it 's too early to tell what happens after that he says 
 but mr. tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract he told u.s. senators last june 
 cbs will pay an average of $ N million more each year than abc and nbc had paid together and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season 
 yet cbs will air only N regular-season games N fewer than abc and nbc 
 that has <unk> some fans 
 it also indicates a $ N million drop in ad sales for regular-season games a risk cbs took to get an unprecedented lock on all <unk> games 
 if the playoffs end in four-game <unk> losses could soar 
 advertisers are <unk> higher prices which would help close the gap 
 cbs signed general motors and toyota to be the only <unk> sponsors in baseball for four years 
 price $ N million 
 but ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ N for a <unk> ad in the world series through N N N less than what abc is charging for the series this month 
 moreover there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably from the <unk> price says arnold chase of bozell inc 
 other <unk> however say rates could rise later if ad spending <unk> 
 the winter games outlook also is mixed 
 cbs expects to make modest profits but rivals contend that it will take a beating 
 abc lost $ N million on the N winter games partly because of its $ N million rights fee 
 it aired N hours of mostly live events in calgary helping raise ratings slightly from N but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers 
 cbs will add N N hours to that load in N and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events 
 all prime-time fare will be on <unk> because of time differences with norway so the results can be announced on the N <unk> news 
 turner broadcasting will pay cbs $ N million to air N hours of cbs coverage plus N hours of additional events 
 barry frank the agent who took mr. pilson to lunch last march says that even if cbs loses say $ N million it matters little 
 ten million ai n't jack man when you got $ N billion sitting in the bank says mr. frank senior vice president at international management group citing cbs 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses 
 it does n't mean anything it 's public-relations money 
 moreover sports has claimed its place as a guaranteed <unk> says david j. stern the commissioner of the national basketball association 
 this is n't <unk> bidding this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it 
 i would tend to trust their judgment 
 that 's easy for him to say cbs 's four-year <unk> pact now at $ N million for four years could double in price by the time his talks with mr. pilson are completed later this month 
 that would cut into cbs 's slim margin for profit and error 
 cbs sports earned $ N million or so last year 
 and cbs takes in the least money in prime time abc and nbc charge N N to N N more for ads according to a variety survey 
 but cbs 's costs are huge and the risks go up with each new sports package that cbs <unk> up 
 although sports officials predict <unk> of N N to N N in the major contracts coming up for renewal ad rates may rise only N N 
 cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time 
 but the savings will be <unk> 
 each hour of olympics and baseball in prime time will cost cbs $ N million to $ N million an <unk> drama costs only $ N and it is aired twice 
 cbs may cushion losses with about $ N million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling cbs records and other businesses 
 but <unk> analyst richard j. macdonald of macdonald <unk> <unk> says wall street wo n't take <unk> to that 
 on a <unk> basis the network ought to make money he says 
 when mr. pilson is asked directly can you make money on all this he does n't exactly say yes 
 what you 're really asking is are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management he says 
 then he answers his own question 
 yes they are 
 that 's the only question we need to address 
 place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line 
 bosses have big <unk> these days 
 or open up an electronics magazine and <unk> the ads for <unk> tape recorders and other <unk> <unk> 
 some would make even james bond green with envy 
 <unk> both corporate and private is on the rise thanks to the proliferation of <unk> technologies 
 and while sellers of the equipment and companies monitoring employees have few <unk> <unk> advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed 
 new technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work says <unk> goldman a staff attorney at the american civil <unk> union 
 our expectation of <unk> is being eroded 
 on the corporate side companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service 
 the practice is common at catalog insurance and phone companies banks and <unk> according to trade groups and worker organizations 
 it 's also widespread for reservations <unk> in the airline <unk> hotel and railroad industries 
 the communications workers of america which opposes such monitoring says supervisors listen in on an estimated N million calls each year 
 among companies saying they monitor employees are united airlines american airlines united parcel service nynex corp. spiegel inc. and the circulation department of this newspaper 
 some wall street firms monitor for <unk> purposes 
 dictaphone corp. says there 's a big business demand for its <unk> taping systems whether the sophisticated <unk> N system which costs from $ N to $ N and can record N conversations simultaneously or simple <unk> units selling for $ N 
 businesses want to <unk> information and ensure <unk> says john <unk> dictaphone 's manager of media relations 
 the state of alaska recently bought the <unk> system he says to monitor the exxon cleanup effort 
 merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. say they use <unk> systems to record and <unk> orders between salesmen and traders 
 shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks such as commodities and futures for about four years 
 both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped 
 kidder peabody & co. says it monitors <unk> conversations between brokers and customers to <unk> order <unk> 
 <unk> by individuals is harder to measure 
 but devices are there for the asking whether in stores or through the mail 
 the counter spy shop in washington d.c. for instance offers the secret connection <unk> case which can <unk> record conversations for nine hours at a stretch 
 that and other fancy <unk> may cost thousands but simple <unk> tape recorders sell for as little as $ N at electronics stores like radio shack 
 the most common use of <unk> devices is in <unk> cases say private investigators 
 while tape <unk> to <unk> say <unk> are n't <unk> in court they can mean leverage in a settlement 
 concerned with the increased availability of <unk> technology and heavier use of it lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue 
 nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring 
 and four states california florida michigan and pennsylvania have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded 
 two bills in congress hope to make such restrictions national 
 in may rep. don edwards d. calif introduced congressional legislation that would require an <unk> <unk> during any employee monitoring warning people that they are being heard 
 the legislation is similar to a N <unk> bill that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the <unk> industry 
 also last spring rep. ron <unk> d. calif. introduced a bill requiring universal <unk> consent to any <unk> in cases that do n't involve law enforcement 
 in addition products such as <unk> tape recorders would have to include <unk> <unk> and labels explaining federal laws on <unk> 
 the outlook on both federal bills is uncertain especially <unk> the N defeat 
 the <unk> and worker organizations back tighter laws but employers and device manufacturers object 
 i 'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun says richard <unk> of the direct marketing association of america which is lobbying <unk> against the edwards <unk> bill 
 but the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening 
 the powerful group which represents many of the nation 's <unk> was instrumental in <unk> the N bill 
 spiegel also opposes the <unk> bill saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders causing <unk> and even errors 
 <unk> dale center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in <unk> nev. <unk> monitoring 
 we like to follow up and make sure operators are <unk> our standards of company service says ms. dale who <unk> N operators 
 john <unk> a nynex spokesman says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job

 federal <unk> statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes 
 and in the past congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations 
 but opponents led by the <unk> say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and N N of monitored workers are n't represented by unions

 the hottest <unk> in the computer industry <unk> sharply yesterday as digital equipment corp. announced its first line of mainframe computers targeting international business machines corp. 's largest market 
 ibm fired back with new mainframes of its own extending the <unk> N line with a N N to N N power boost 
 up to now the intense competition between ibm and digital has been confined largely to the broad <unk> of the computer market where digital sought to exploit ibm 's weaknesses in <unk> 
 but digital 's move into mainframes will target ibm 's home turf where it has a commanding N N share of the market 
 digital maynard mass. insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from ibm 's 
 this is not your father 's mainframe said <unk> <unk> a digital spokesman 
 it 's a whole new generation he said 
 ibm which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes also announced upgraded operating system software that together with the new hardware lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as N N faster 
 batch processing is the <unk> <unk> data processing that most mainframes typically <unk> through at night such as <unk> accounts at banks 
 ibm said the N new <unk> and <unk> models will generally be available immediately though three wo n't ship until the third quarter of next year 
 prices on the larger models which range as high as $ N million generally wo n't change 
 small models whose performance increased as much as N N will carry higher prices 
 <unk> to bigger models also will be <unk> 
 digital 's vax N mainframes which it claimed were among the fastest available were priced from $ N million to $ N million sharply lower than ibm models of comparable power 
 the first models will ship in the spring with the largest following in the fall 
 analysts were disappointed that digital 's new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year which begins in july 
 jay stevens of dean witter reynolds inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year 
 but he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal N at the same time 
 after the announcement yesterday digital shares gained $ N to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 ibm shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board trading 
 analysts have predicted strong <unk> demand for the new line among digital 's customers 
 large digital buyers say the new vax will let them stay with digital when they need the power of a mainframe instead of turning to ibm 
 i 'm convinced there 's a huge market for this machine said stephen smith of painewebber inc 
 digital also plans to compete fiercely with ibm when the giant 's customers are <unk> new aspects of their businesses 
 digital however does n't expect to <unk> ibm mainframes that are already installed at big companies 
 in addition to commercial markets digital 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market when it 's packaged with an <unk> <unk> known as a <unk> <unk> 
 digital 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay <unk> line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the <unk> systems that older minicomputers use 
 although digital has <unk> out a major presence in the booming workstation market profit margins in that market are much <unk> than for mainframes 
 the <unk> mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately 
 ibm 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year with analysts estimating they have risen N N to N N 
 demand for these systems has been very very strong said bill <unk> a senior ibm marketing executive 
 we have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without the systems that were announced yesterday 
 but the N line is nearly five years old which is getting up there in mainframe years and its growth is expected to slow in N 
 ibm armonk n.y. said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year 
 the fourth quarter is always ibm 's biggest by far with most sales coming in december as customers seek to use budgets before year end 
 still steve cohen an analyst at <unk> financial group inc. said i do n't see that this will be sufficient to give ibm a significant kick in the fourth quarter 
 ibm has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of ibm 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars 
 some analysts have estimated ibm 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall N N to $ N a share from $ N a share a year earlier 
 in addition to the new mainframe hardware and software ibm announced a <unk> system for data storage that it said <unk> half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single <unk> 
 that should help ibm address the damage that a <unk> storage technology corp. has <unk> in that market

 the white house called on congress to <unk> the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill but lawmakers seem likely to <unk> at the idea 
 earlier this month the white house endorsed <unk> the controversial tax measure from the bill so that congress could pass quickly a clean bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the gramm-rudman act 
 but now that congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the gramm-rudman targets the white house said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill on which congress continues to work 
 if that does n't happen then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote said press secretary marlin fitzwater 
 on capitol hill though there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill 
 texas rep. william <unk> the ranking republican on the house ways and means committee said i do n't see how we have the votes to place a capital-gains tax cut there 
 meanwhile president bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut

 the first meeting yesterday was with N senate democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax 
 according to some who attended the senators argued that the president should give the democratic leaders in congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue 
 issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending 
 the president was said to have been <unk>

 the disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at campeau corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has <unk> through some of the nation 's largest law firms

 quickview systems inc. said it filed a lawsuit against apple computer inc. claiming patent infringement in an element of apple 's popular <unk> software program 
 the suit filed in minneapolis federal court claims that apple violated a quickview patent that allows computer users to display only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire <unk> of any given field 
 the <unk> program allows users to design applications for <unk> computers without having to be <unk> programmers and is distributed with every <unk> sold 
 it 's one of the most popular computer programs of all time but analysts said the quickview suit does n't appear to <unk> major difficulties for apple 
 the technology at issue is not an underlying technology of <unk> to my knowledge said danny goodman a san <unk> <unk> program developer 
 nonetheless the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for quickview claimed could run into the millions of dollars 
 in cupertino calif. apple said that it believes the case has no merit and that <unk> does not <unk> any valid claims of the quickview patents

 this is in response to <unk> kageyama 's manager 's journal looking for the real thing in sony editorial page oct. N 
 though i agree with many of mr. kageyama 's comments i believe he points the gun in the wrong direction it is n't the americans who must be criticized for not understanding the japanese culture but the japanese who insist on forcing their culture on americans 
 the japanese want us to accept their culture but they refuse to accept the american culture 
 japanese managers ca n't expect americans to <unk> as if they were japanese instead they must manage americans as americans 
 americans are expected to conform to the japanese culture when in japan 
 what is wrong with expecting the japanese to conform to american <unk> when they <unk> here 
 americans place native or native <unk> in charge of subsidiaries overseas 
 european <unk> do likewise even in america their affiliates are usually run by american managers 
 but the japanese insist upon japanese managers everywhere they set up shop 
 do the japanese feel so superior that they can not find capable american managers

 mr. kageyama suggests that <unk> electronics industries workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses ' perspective 
 while mr. kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences both cultural and <unk> i question his perspective 
 would he suggest that employees of an american company doing business in japan conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy 
 obviously not 
 thus the conclusion is that the burden <unk> with management to <unk> the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating 
 the workers can be motivated and the company reach its full potential only when management <unk> the employees ' perspective 
 a. <unk> <unk> president municipal code corp <unk> fla 
 i believe mr. kageyama left out one major aspect of japanese culture that <unk> his piece the belief in the <unk> of japanese culture and behavior vs. others 
 a manager should not have to <unk> the opinions of his employees about the style of his management 
 instead he should listen to see how that criticism can be used <unk> to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates 
 japanese culture vs. american culture is irrelevant 
 the key is how a manager from one culture can <unk> employees from another 
 for mr. kageyama to argue that american employees must <unk> accept a direct <unk> of the japanese way of doing things is outright cultural <unk> of the first order 
 the japanese are <unk> the opportunity to <unk> a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national <unk> 
 mr. kageyama is accurate to deny a specific <unk> bias 
 it is more difficult to deny a general <unk> in seeing things only the japanese way 
 when the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without <unk> the reasons for the criticism i am convinced that mr. kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms

 as a presidential candidate in N george bush <unk> expressed his position on abortion in an interview with rolling stone magazine published that march 
 what did he think of the supreme court 's decision <unk> abortion 
 i happen to think it was right mr. bush said <unk> 
 a few months later mr. bush became ronald reagan 's running <unk> 
 suddenly george bush the pro-choice advocate became george bush the <unk> 
 and the <unk> did n't end there 
 just a month ago mr. bush <unk> threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds except to save a woman 's life 
 then two weeks ago declaring that i 'm not looking for any conflict over this the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest 
 but only four days after that mr. bush <unk> the veto threat 
 i do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened he proclaimed and finally vetoed the measure last weekend 
 so what does george bush really believe 
 the answer is so <unk> that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly <unk> increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue 
 the result is <unk> and criticism from all around 
 anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally 
 in all honesty if you ask me is this man a true <unk> i do n't know says john <unk> head of the washington-based ad <unk> committee in defense of life inc 
 yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical 
 douglas gould vice president of communications for the planned <unk> federation of america calls mr. bush 's position on the <unk> issue extremely <unk> adding the guy has n't done one thing about prevention 
 he 's totally geared to a punitive position 
 mr. bush is <unk> uncomfortable with the entire abortion question 
 for most of the past nine years he has <unk> to convince anti-abortion activists of his <unk> support for their position 
 but ever since the supreme court 's webster vs. reproductive health services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall 
 many americans still <unk> over their own personal feelings about abortion 
 mr. bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be <unk> over the issue as it is that he seems to <unk> on it 
 the political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and <unk> to it experts insist 
 if you have a position you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much says republican strategist john sears 
 the need for <unk> is especially <unk> for mr. bush who mr. sears maintains lacks a strong ideological base 
 by his moderate republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters the president might seem to have at least some <unk> with abortion-rights arguments 
 yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white house 
 on many issues <unk> for instance his keen political <unk> overcome such conflicts 
 but mr. bush and his advisers <unk> the politics of the abortion issue failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer 's supreme court decision to restrict those rights in the webster case 
 it was one of the <unk> changes in public attitudes i 've ever seen says former reagan <unk> richard <unk> 
 these days when others raise the subject of abortion the usually <unk> president can be <unk> almost to the point of <unk> 
 ten days ago he was asked to <unk> the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance 
 my position is well-known and <unk> he replied 
 a close look at his record over the last N years suggests that mr. bush has <unk> his views on all sides of the issue 
 in N as the u.s. representative to the united nations he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he <unk> of his leadership during his term in congress in expanding <unk> services for the poor 
 running for president in early N he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother 
 in his rolling stone interview in N mr. bush <unk> his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival ronald reagan 
 in addition to supporting the landmark roe vs. wade supreme court decision <unk> abortion mr. bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that mr. reagan was promising to promote 
 as mr. reagan 's running <unk> though mr. bush plunged <unk> into the anti-abortion position <unk> a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion 
 he acknowledged only one difference with mr. reagan that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life 
 throughout the early 1980s mr. bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it 
 in april N <unk> president bush had his staff write a letter <unk> out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape incest and life <unk> but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case 
 at the gop convention last year he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape incest and life <unk> 
 his rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office <unk> his firm support of our cause during an anti-abortion rally three days after his <unk> last january 
 he again urged passage of a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion 
 but when the high court ruled in the webster case in july the president began to lower the volume 
 when the ruling was handed down the <unk> president dispatched chief of staff john <unk> to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself 
 he did later threaten <unk> over legislation restoring the district of columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the united nations population fund 
 but in the months since then while trying to drum up support for other issues such as an <unk> constitutional amendment he has <unk> away from talking about abortion 
 what few comments he has initiated have been <unk> such as urging greater efforts toward the protection of human life at a meeting of catholic lawyers in boston last month 
 the white house has likewise avoided any involvement in florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to <unk> abortion restrictions 
 the session failed to enact any new curbs 
 now some see mr. bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape

 for the more than N million americans with disabilities the N americans with disabilities act provides the missing piece 
 disabled americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since section N was passed as a part of the N rehabilitation act

 goodyear tire & rubber co. buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment reported that third-quarter net income rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share 
 in the year-ago period goodyear had net of $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales rose slightly to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 analysts had mixed responses to the results 
 donald <unk> an independent analyst in new <unk> conn. said he was impressed with the company 's performance 
 he said results were better than he 'd expected and indicate that goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year 
 however harry <unk> an analyst at mcdonald & co. cleveland said goodyear 's results fell at the bottom of his range of estimates 
 excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency <unk> mr. <unk> said the company 's results were still a little disappointing 
 goodyear 's stock which has been weak in recent weeks fell $ N yesterday to close at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the <unk> <unk> company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about N N to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier reflecting improvements in raw material costs sales of replacement tires and pricing 
 mcdonald 's mr. <unk> said goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the u.s. for the first time since the second quarter of N 
 but goodyear said total u.s. tire unit sales were off about N N 
 total tire segment sales were up only about N N to $ N billion and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its u.s. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and <unk> production by auto makers 
 in the latest quarter goodyear 's tax rate was N N compared with N N a year earlier 
 as a result total tax outlays were $ N million compared with $ N million the year earlier 
 for the nine months profit skidded about N N reflecting charges taken in this year 's second quarter and the effect of <unk> of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger u.s. dollar 
 net was $ N million or $ N a share compared with net of $ N million or $ N a share the year earlier 
 the latest nine months included charges of $ N million related to the company 's south african subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit 
 sales rose nearly N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 environmental control group inc. said it expects to report minimal earnings or a loss for the third quarter 
 the environmental services company said that the <unk> of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in <unk> reserves probably will result in charges of $ N million to $ N million most of which will be taken against third-quarter results

 former usx corp. chairman david m. roderick may have been lucky he retired last may 
 as he handed over the reins to successor charles a. corry steel profits were close to a cyclical peak 
 though imports were troublesome they were n't running away with the market and american companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years 
 perhaps most important carl icahn who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was subdued 
 he and mr. roderick were even <unk> out together 
 today mr. corry <unk> over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly 
 mr. icahn the company 's <unk> <unk> adversary recently disclosed that he had raised his usx stake to N N and he again threatened a takeover 
 a battle with mr. icahn would <unk> even the most <unk> chief executive to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago 
 in addition usx 's giant steel segment representing N N of its N sales is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills 
 the import quotas got only a N 1\/2-year extension and usx is <unk> under a staggering $ N billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil 
 it 's a <unk> of fire for corry says one usx executive 
 the burning question is whether the new chief can <unk> mr. icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves 
 mr. corry might have to <unk> the company more than he wants to 
 or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying mr. icahn 's stock possibly at a premium or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of mr. icahn 's pressure 
 with his recent purchases of usx common stock mr. icahn shattered a <unk> <unk> standstill agreement with mr. roderick 
 in N mr. roderick <unk> <unk> mr. icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an N N stake 
 mr. roderick did so by having usx redeem a series of guaranteed notes a move that in effect raised the cost of a $ N billion icahn bid by about $ N billion 
 and he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the <unk> 
 over <unk> at new york 's sky club and links club restaurants the steel executive and the big investor talked steel international trade and thoroughbred horses 
 mr. corry who has <unk> up on corporate raiders by reading t. boone pickens 's <unk> had hoped the <unk> would continue 
 he was shocked associates say to learn of mr. icahn 's new takeover threat 
 both men declined to be interviewed for this article 
 but the fiercely competitive mr. corry quickly showed he 's no <unk> 
 he <unk> with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent 
 although the board believed that mr. icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring usx it adopted a <unk> defense to be <unk> if anyone <unk> a N N stake 
 now it 's mr. icahn 's move 
 will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of usx into separate oil and steel companies 
 given the weakness of the junk-bond market can he finance a buy-out 
 mr. icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in texaco inc. in june a coup that gave him enough cash to make his usx move 
 and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets by making it harder to arrange takeover financing has eased some of the pressure on mr. corry it does n't end the takeover threat 
 i know it 's not over a <unk> mr. corry acknowledged while <unk> steel suppliers in new york on oct. N and inviting them to a buffet of <unk> and <unk> in honor of kobe steel ltd. usx 's partner in a steel mill in <unk> ohio 
 in fact it 's barely begun for mr. corry who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job 
 he 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own says <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at painewebber inc 
 the <unk> tax attorney never even <unk> to the job of chief executive 
 an <unk> college student who <unk> in <unk> until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up <unk> mr. corry wanted to work for a big company that could do big things 
 but after joining the tax department of a usx subsidiary N years ago he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of N 
 for years he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms wearing a hat to work because everyone else did 
 i was never a rebel he said in an earlier interview 
 i do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry 
 yet the <unk> mr. corry helped chart usx 's transition from big steel to big oil 
 he served as mr. roderick 's front man in <unk> negotiations for the N purchase of marathon oil for $ N billion 
 nevertheless mr. corry once named chief executive did n't waste any time <unk> himself from his former boss who still has an office on the <unk> floor of the usx tower in pittsburgh 
 soon after taking over last june mr. corry <unk> a pay cut imposed on <unk> workers a move that mr. roderick had n't made in spite of improved earnings 
 mr. corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in pittsburgh instead of new york or <unk> ohio marathon 's home 
 and earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of texas oil & gas which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since 
 one former executive says nobody wanted that deal inside usx except dave roderick who was a hunting and fishing buddy of william l. <unk> chairman of texas oil & gas 
 the executive recalls mr. corry <unk> to him and others remember this was dave 's deal 
 what <unk> many usx executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for $ N billion of stock doubled the usx shares outstanding and considerably diluted them 
 what 's more the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in N years 
 mr. corry expected the texas oil & gas sale to <unk> mr. icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value 
 but when the two men met in new york a day after mr. icahn disclosed the rise in his usx stake mr. corry learned that mr. icahn wanted him to sell all of texas oil not just its reserves of about N trillion cubic feet of natural gas and N million barrels of oil but also its pipeline <unk> and <unk> operations 
 that would leave usx with marathon its steel mills and its diversified business segment which includes among other things mineral and transportation products 
 some speculate that mr. corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price 
 the problem is that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned 
 mr. icahn has long believed associates say that the company whose N sales totaled $ N billion is worth $ N a share if broken up 
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N giving mr. icahn 's N million shares a value of $ N billion 
 mr. icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations and mr. corry does n't necessarily disagree 
 unlike his predecessor who saw steel as america 's <unk> mr. corry tends to view it as a <unk> and <unk> business with limited potential associates say 
 in the past five years usx has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs 
 but the short-term outlook is <unk> 
 it is n't surprising that messrs. roderick and corry view steel so differently 
 while mr. roderick was <unk> in the <unk> of pittsburgh 's smoking mills mr. corry grew up in cincinnati a city <unk> <unk> and more accustomed to pork <unk> than <unk> iron 
 he has never met lynn williams the president of the united steelworkers union and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group the american iron and steel institute which mr. roderick served as chairman 
 dave thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while chuck agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says 
 indeed mr. corry at an august press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer 
 however shedding steel would run directly counter to mr. roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas having two major products would <unk> the company 's <unk> to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings 
 as mr. roderick once said we 're a <unk> company and boy if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts you are so damn <unk> that you do n't belong on wall street 
 moreover the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to usx may be gone for now 
 the time has passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends 
 about the only way that usx now can get out of steel is to <unk> it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds 
 with mr. icahn breathing down his neck however mr. corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some <unk> tax-loss <unk> 
 that would leave usx essentially an oil company with marathon as its core 
 marathon has benefited from higher <unk> prices and strong demand for refined products 
 oil has long been mr. corry 's pet 
 indeed when the bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions <unk> the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years mr. corry and his directors were aboard <unk> high above marathon 's rich oil reserves in the north sea 
 should usx be left with only marathon mr. corry might well feel pushed to <unk> out other energy companies 
 however even usx executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals 
 i do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says 
 right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets 
 one thing is certain however mr. corry while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr. icahn 's intentions 
 and then he wo n't panic says j. bruce johnston a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> cohen & <unk> in pittsburgh 
 mr. corry learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what mr. johnston calls <unk> negotiations that led to usx 's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction 
 when negotiating mr. corry played his cards close to the <unk> 
 <unk> johnson who worked for mr. corry in strategic planning recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates 
 what he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you did n't know that 
 he wanted your own <unk> virgin opinion says mr. johnson now managing director at <unk> & co. a <unk> and <unk> firm 
 ever the <unk> mr. corry said in august that he realized that usx is on acquisition screens all over the country 
 it 's part of the <unk> market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought he said 
 usx he noted was formed N years ago by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies 
 people got rich through takeovers in those days as they do today

 israel has launched a new effort to prove the <unk> liberation organization continues to practice terrorism and thus to persuade the u.s. to break off talks with the group

 israeli <unk> officials provided the state department with a <unk> list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by plo chairman <unk> arafat 
 mr. arafat publicly <unk> terrorism dec. N satisfying the u.s. <unk> for a direct dialogue with the plo 
 a u.s. <unk> official said experts are studying the israeli list 
 we have no independent evidence linking <unk> to any acts of terrorism since dec. N N he said referring to the specific plo group that mr. arafat heads 
 so far this list does n't change our view 
 israel wants to end the dialogue but our analysts take a different view than theirs 
 israeli prime minister <unk> shamir 's top adviser on <unk> <unk> <unk> was here monday to present the report to members of congress reporters and others 
 mr. <unk> said he also presented the list last week to william brown u.s. ambassador to israel 
 separately the new york times reported that the israeli government had provided its <unk> in <unk> with different documents that israel said prove the plo has been conducting terrorism from the occupied arab <unk> 
 the state department said it has n't yet seen copies of those papers 
 if the dialogue was based on the assumption that arafat or the plo would stop terrorism and we have evidence of continued terrorism what would be the logical conclusion mr. <unk> asked 
 israel has long claimed mr. arafat never meant to <unk> terrorism particularly because he and his <unk> reserved the right to press armed struggle against the jewish state 
 now <unk> says it is backing up its <unk> with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to mr. arafat 
 it blames most of these on <unk> 
 the new accusations come at a delicate time in u.s. efforts to bring about talks between israel and palestinian representatives 
 the state department said it had received a new letter on the subject from israeli foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> israel 's previous <unk> to negotiating with any palestinian tied to the plo 
 deciding what <unk> terrorism can be a <unk> exercise 
 the u.s. <unk> it as <unk> politically motivated violence <unk> against <unk> targets by <unk> groups or <unk> state agents 
 to meet the u.s. criteria israel contended it only listed incidents that involved <unk> and occurred inside its <unk> borders 
 at the heart of israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents <unk> attributes to <unk> including the use of <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 but u.s. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be <unk> of the <unk> the palestinian <unk> in the occupied <unk> which the u.s. does n't <unk> as terrorism 
 in addition the officials say israel has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by <unk> or by any group mr. arafat controls 
 u.s. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the <unk> of the separate documents <unk> to the new york times 
 the papers which israel says were discovered in <unk> <unk> refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called the revolutionary <unk> 
 some supporters of israel say u.s. policy on palestinian terrorism is <unk> by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the plo 
 but state department officials accuse israel of <unk> questionable claims to <unk> the u.s.

 boston co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years 
 in N for example boston co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ N million while shearson managed net income of just $ N million 
 shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries 
 but people familiar with boston co. 's performance say the unit had profit of around $ N million for the third quarter after barely breaking even for the first six months 
 shearson meanwhile posted net income of $ N million for the first nine months of the year down slightly from $ N million for the year-ago period 
 moody 's investors service inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of boston co. 's boston safe deposit & trust co. subsidiary to single-a-1 from <unk> citing problems in the company 's aggressively managed securities portfolio 
 john <unk> a moody 's vice president said boston safe deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a <unk> in the maturities of its assets and liabilities 
 the <unk> exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk and when rates moved <unk> beginning late last year and continuing into this year it cost them mr. <unk> said 
 mr. <unk> noted that boston safe deposit has taken some actions to better control <unk> management and improve controls in general and we think these will serve to improve credit quality 
 as some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested the problems ought to ease he said 
 but he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled new england real estate market 
 boston co. officials declined to comment on moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results 
 an accounting controversy at the end of last year forced boston co. to admit it had <unk> pretax profits by some $ N million 
 the resulting scandal led to the <unk> of james n. von <unk> as boston co. 's president and to the resignations of the company 's chief financial officer and treasurer 
 the executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and <unk> revenue early in an effort to dress up results and perhaps bolster <unk> bonuses 
 mr. von <unk> in turn attributed the controversy to <unk> errors by accountants and accused shearson of conducting a <unk> hunt 
 mr. <unk> of moody 's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year 
 the company 's current management found itself locked into this he said

 sears roebuck & co. is struggling as it enters the critical christmas season 
 yesterday the retailing and financial services giant reported a N N drop in third-quarter earnings to $ N million or N cents a share from a restated $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 but the news was even worse for sears 's core u.s. retailing operation the largest in the nation 
 sears said its u.s. stores had a loss of $ N million their first deficit for the period in more than five years 
 analysts estimated that sales at u.s. stores declined in the quarter too 
 the results underscore sears 's difficulties in <unk> the everyday low pricing strategy that it adopted in march as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business 
 under the new approach sears set prices that were somewhere between its old regular and sale prices 
 the company said it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers 
 sears officials insist they do n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results 
 instead a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods which account for roughly two-thirds of sears 's annual merchandise volume 
 the new pricing strategy is working the spokesman asserted 
 he added that after an initial surge triggered by an advertising <unk> in march sears expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect on revenue 
 sears has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of <unk> merchandise it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls power <unk> 
 but analysts say sears faces an especially <unk> challenge on the <unk> of the christmas shopping season 
 i believe everyday pricing in the current environment does n't work says walter <unk> of morgan stanley & co. pointing to soft <unk> sales 
 sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values 
 in what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as smoothly as sears had hoped the giant retailer is now trying new ways to drum up business without appearing to abandon its <unk> strategy 
 the company is <unk> more special deals in its advertising and stores and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain <unk> items 
 sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message 
 in a new tv ad for instance a woman going through the sunday newspaper brands as <unk> claims by other stores that they are offering goods for N N N N and N N off 
 by lowering prices throughout its stores she says sears has the right idea 
 but the ad also <unk> sears 's sales a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing 
 when sears has a sale at a special price the woman in the ad declares it 's something you do n't want to miss 
 recent surveys by leo j. shapiro & associates a market research firm in chicago suggest that sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise 
 the number of people who said they were more likely to shop at sears fell in september to N N from N N in march when sears <unk> the <unk> with ads about its new pricing strategy 
 moreover the number of people who <unk> cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in sears declined to N N in september from N N in march 
 just N N of the respondents mentioned brands in september up slightly from N N in march 
 only N N of the people in september cited sears 's friendly personnel 
 the power of price as an appeal which was very considerable in driving traffic in march and april has diminished says george <unk> president of shapiro & associates 
 you see some improvement in these other areas but it 's a very small and slow process 
 for the third quarter sears said its total revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 net income at sears 's merchandise group which includes international and credit card operations as well as u.s. stores fell N N 
 profit at sears 's <unk> insurance unit fell N N to $ N million because of hurricane hugo which <unk> the greatest single storm damage loss in the company 's history 
 sears said claims from the storm as expected reduced its third-quarter net by $ N million or N cents a share 
 <unk> is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter as claims pour in from the san francisco earthquake 
 but a spokesman said the quake wo n't have as big a financial impact on <unk> as hurricane hugo did 
 net income at sears 's dean witter <unk> services group meanwhile rose nearly N N to $ N million reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and discover credit card businesses 
 profit at sears 's <unk> banker real estate group nearly <unk> to $ N million because of gains on sales of property 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday sears shares closed at $ N up N cents 
 oil imports to japan rose N N in september from year-earlier levels according to statistics released by the government 's ministry of international trade and industry 
 the imports totaling N million barrels were N N lower than august levels 
 the <unk> rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products and partly because of tax changes in N that left oil companies with high inventories in the <unk> period 
 imports of crude from the middle east grew N N from year-earlier levels and southeast asian crude imports grew N N 
 while mideast crude imports were higher compared with year-earlier levels they fell N N compared with august imports 
 southeast asian crude imports however were N N higher than august 
 this is in response to george <unk> 's business world column the housing market is a bigger mess than you think <unk> page sept. N 
 in houston we have seen how bad the housing problem can become 
 unused houses <unk> rapidly affecting the value of nearby homes in a <unk> effect the entire neighborhood can fall victim 
 at this stage some people just walk away from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value 
 but most of them could have <unk> to keep up their payments they chose not to do so 
 the problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions in <unk> experiments 
 here are some ideas 
 N foreclosed homes could be sold by the fha for no down payment the biggest obstacle to young buyers but with personal liability for the mortgage no walking away by choice 
 N encourage long-term <unk> by <unk> one month 's payment off the <unk> end of the mortgage for every six months paid or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage balloon but <unk> on a monthly <unk> basis as long as the owner remains the <unk> 
 N develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the <unk> 
 an <unk> will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house 
 in this way the house is not dumped on to a <unk> market

 worse the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so but are <unk> eventually because of the <unk> of the low down payment etc to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle <unk> itself all over again

 david t. <unk> xerox chairman and chief executive officer cited the restructuring and strong cost controls for the N N growth in profit from business products and systems operations 
 mr. glazer expects xerox to experience tough <unk> though in financial services because of rate pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains 
 in the quarter the <unk> & <unk> insurance unit reported $ N million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations 
 the subsidiary also increased reserves by $ N million however and set aside an additional $ N million for claims connected with hurricane hugo

 new orders for durable goods fell back slightly in september after shooting up the month before reflecting weakening auto demand after a <unk> of orders for new N models the commerce department reported 
 orders for military equipment household appliances machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped N N last month to $ N billion after leaping N N in august the department said 
 most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in august 
 moreover a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a <unk> 
 but many economists pointed to a N N september rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category 
 that suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart said <unk> <unk> an economist at manufacturers hanover securities corp. in new york 
 she added however it is not robust by any means 
 while a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment <unk> it up 
 orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed N N and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases including airplanes missiles ships tanks and communications equipment 
 orders for military goods usually <unk> in september government officials say as the pentagon <unk> to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins oct. N 
 while all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations a commerce department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the <unk> surge in defense orders 
 without the increase in defense bookings september orders would have plummeted N N 
 analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping 
 unfilled orders for durable goods rose N N in september to $ N billion after declining for the first time in N N years in august 
 in july unfilled orders grew N N 
 but analysts noted that excluding transportation where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures order backlogs have declined for three months in a row 
 it means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going 
 that is a little disturbing ms. <unk> said 
 it also means if you have a real <unk> in orders production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going 
 capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row posting a N N drop after a N N decline 
 such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would <unk> be grave news for the economy 
 but a commerce department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year 
 still milton hudson senior economic adviser at morgan guaranty trust co. in new york said if you look back a <unk> or so the evidence was pretty good of <unk> strength in the <unk> sector

 in a statement arnold b. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer noted that the new repurchase program should serve to enhance shareholder value

 analysts said they expected the action and investors <unk> the move 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange norfolk southern shares closed at $ N up $ N 
 still analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term 
 the impact wo n't be that great said <unk> <unk> of first boston corp 
 that is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding she said 
 in addition mrs. <unk> said norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus <unk> some interest income 
 longer term however the buy-back is expected to increase earnings especially after N mrs. <unk> said 
 moreover the extensive program in effect <unk> a floor for the stock price said joel price analyst for donaldson lufkin & jenrette 
 the buy-back is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a price floor he said 
 at a certain price if the management thinks the stock is cheap they can go in and buy it

 japan has climbed up from the <unk> of world war ii and a gross national product of about $ N per capita to reach the <unk> class among industrialized nations 
 now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern democratic developed nation mode of operation 
 until N when japan joined the $ N per capita gnp club of the advanced countries it was a model developing nation 
 the government built ports bridges highways schools hospitals and <unk> 
 when industries were weak it protected them 
 it gave the japanese people a value system based on the <unk> that given the country 's lack of natural resources they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus 
 individual prosperity inevitably would result 
 that system has worked 
 the standard of living has increased steadily over the past N years more than N N of the people consider themselves middle class

 the ldp won by a <unk> in the last election in july N 
 but less than two years later the ldp started to <unk> and dissent rose to unprecedented heights 
 the symptoms all point to one thing japan does not have a modern government 
 its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat set the speed step on the gas apply the <unk> and steer with N million people in the back seat 
 in a modern system the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice 
 it also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world 
 the japanese government does n't allow this 
 the ministry of agriculture and <unk> actually is a ministry for farmers and <unk> instead of a ministry of provisions 
 the ministry of health and welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people 
 the ministry of education is nothing but a <unk> for licensed teachers and certainly does not act on behalf of students 
 the ministry of construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that japan 's <unk> roadway per capita is the longest in the world but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic 
 the ministry of transportation serves the industry certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices 
 and the ministry of foreign affairs works for itself supporting japanese diplomats who <unk> abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's 
 this ministry has done nothing to correct the <unk> and <unk> that are at the root of japan 's deteriorating image 
 instead it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its <unk> of influence <unk> a <unk> other ministries 
 all this illustrates that japanese ministries still have a provider mentality they do not serve the people and particularly not consumers 
 they serve the industries and the special-interest groups 
 the rest of the world accepted such methods when japan was developing 
 japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing <unk> 
 japan is not a political country 
 it is a bureaucratic country 
 the diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system 
 most bills are drafted by bureaucrats not politicians 
 the diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever ldp does that it would be a waste of time 
 so most bills are passed without full discussion particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties 
 a recent example is the N N consumption tax on all commercial activities 
 this makes enormous sense in japan where direct tax accounts for more than N N of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair 
 if you are a <unk> man <unk> N N captured 
 if you are a retailer N N and a farmer N N 
 to correct this <unk> most people would have favored an indirect tax like the consumption tax 
 but the bill was passed without debate in the diet in the absence of the opposition

 they were N or N

 in the recent upper house and tokyo metropolitan congressional elections in which the socialist party won a runaway victory N N of all women voted as opposed to the usual N N 
 it is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to recruit the sex scandals or the <unk> coins in their <unk> but they obviously were voting to punish the ldp

 against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the socialist party the ldp has been <unk> 
 now is the time to reform the government from a provider developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice 
 if the ldp as currently composed ca n't make the <unk> then it should split into two parties 
 one party could stand for consumer interests small government free trade and <unk> to put japan clearly among the most developed and open countries 
 the other party could continue on the traditional track of the ldp representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government control regulation and <unk> 
 the ldp must make a decision immediately lower house elections must take place before june

 just after hurricane hugo battered south carolina some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes 
 gov. campbell responded they 're <unk> <unk> when there 's been a hanging in the family 
 a spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs

 the irs recently amended the policy to cover <unk> charges for checks lost by the irs

 just five acres more are all we need to feel really at home they say

 they plan to expand the home site by buying five <unk> acres for $ N borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized by the N acres 
 their debt will be well under the $ N million limit on borrowing to acquire build or improve a home that <unk> for <unk> deductions 
 as you can guess the <unk> want to <unk> <unk> interest on the $ N loan 
 but irs private ruling N notes no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence 
 so the irs has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence 
 thus the irs says the <unk> ' $ N loan is <unk> debt and interest on it is fully deductible

 he plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him he would <unk> those fees from income reported on his return 
 so he asked the irs if the plan would work

 some fruit <unk> say the fuji could someday tumble the red delicious from the top of america 's apple <unk> 
 it certainly wo n't get there on looks 
 compared to the red delicious the <unk> of apple <unk> the fuji is <unk> more <unk> generally smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> of red 
 to hear most u.s. growers tell it we 'd still be in <unk> if the <unk> had <unk> one to <unk> 
 but how sweet it is 
 it has more sugar than any apple we 've ever tested says <unk> greene a university of massachusetts <unk> or apple scholar 
 it has a long shelf life and does n't fool the public says <unk> <unk> an <unk> wash. grower who is <unk> fujis and spreading the good word about them

 mr. <unk> <unk> sharp at N has picked and packed a <unk> <unk> of apples over the past N years 
 he is known as the father of the <unk> <unk> smith a <unk> different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on

 now even more radical changes seem <unk> as the grand old <unk> of american apples plays the role of <unk> <unk> 
 the fuji is going to be no. N to replace the red delicious he says 
 the delicious <unk> wo n't end anytime soon 
 new apple trees grow slowly and the red delicious is almost as entrenched as mom 
 its roots are <unk> with the first trees appearing in N in an <unk> near peru iowa to be exact 
 for more than N years it has been the apple of our eye 
 a good delicious can indeed be delicious 
 more than twice as many red delicious apples are grown as the golden variety america 's no. N apple 
 but the apple industry is <unk> for change 
 red delicious has been <unk> and its prices have dropped below the cost of production says washington state 's mr. norton 
 the scare over <unk> a growth regulator that makes apples <unk> and <unk> but may be <unk> made consumers shy away from the delicious though they were less affected than the <unk> 
 the <unk> and <unk> lower prices combined with cancer fears was a very serious blow to growers 
 a lot of growers wo n't be around in a few years says mr. norton although they have stopped using <unk> 
 one may be william broderick a sterling mass. grower 
 this is beautiful stuff he says looking <unk> at big boxes of <unk> red delicious next to his <unk> 
 but i 'm going to lose $ N to $ N on it

 even if a grower <unk> them back his $ N <unk> <unk> might <unk> off to the neighbors ' <unk> instead of <unk> his mr. broderick says 
 though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple they can protect themselves against the price <unk> of any one variety by diversifying into the recently imported <unk> a sweet new zealand native the <unk> <unk> reportedly thomas jefferson 's favorite apple <unk> kinds like the liberty 
 i 've <unk> out a lot of delicious and <unk> the trees with many different <unk> says steve wood a west lebanon n.h. grower <unk> through his <unk> poverty lane <unk> on a <unk> autumn day recently

 it 's a real dog 
 supermarkets are getting into the variety act too 
 they still buy apples mainly for big red good looks that 's why so many taste like <unk> ' <unk> bags 
 but <unk> counts more than it once did and stores are expanding shelf space for <unk> but <unk> and often <unk> apples 
 rather than sell <unk> delicious maybe we can sell <unk> fujis says chuck <unk> <unk> director for <unk> <unk> inc. a minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor 
 the fuji is a product of <unk> japanese <unk> engineering which <unk> it N years ago at a government research <unk> 
 japanese researchers have <unk> dozens of <unk> of fujis to <unk> its color taste and shelf life 
 now the best of them age as <unk> as <unk> the industry 's gold standard for <unk> 
 in the <unk> of <unk> apples the fuji 's track record stands out during the past N years it has gone from almost <unk> to some N N of japan 's market 
 the japanese apple market is very <unk> to high quality says david lane a scientist at a canadian <unk> research center in <unk> british columbia and so apples are more of a <unk> there than a big food commodity 
 the u.s. department of agriculture estimates that this year americans will eat about N N more fresh apples per capita than the japanese 
 the fuji is still small potatoes in the u.s. sold mainly in fruit <unk> 
 but in california says craig <unk> a <unk> grower there 's a fuji apple <unk> 
 once somebody <unk> one they get <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the washington grower says that he could sell fujis to taiwan buyers at $ N a box if he had them 
 taiwan already is a big importer of fujis from other places he adds 
 but his first crop wo n't be picked till next year 
 i expect to see the demand exceed supply for fujis for the next N to N years he adds 
 washington red delicious by the way are <unk> for less than $ N a box these days 
 mr. <unk> sees fujis in part as striking a blow against the <unk> of u.s. apples by supermarkets 
 when the chain stores took over there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer 
 a guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you 're going to eat 
 after all until the 1950s even the red delicious was a firm <unk> <unk> 
 then as growers <unk> them more for looks and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long-term storage the red went into decline 
 now those red <unk> things stores sell in summer are <unk> lovely but usually not good eating 
 they do deserve respect however they are almost a year old probably equal to about N in human years 
 the fuji to be sure has <unk> too 
 it <unk> later than most apples and growing it in u.s. areas with <unk> <unk> may be tricky 
 moreover the <unk> fuji must compete with an increasingly <unk> delicious 
 mr. broderick the massachusetts grower says the big boss at a supermarket chain even rejected his red delicious recently because they were n't <unk> and brushed for extra <unk> 
 and he had n't used <unk> which many growers employ to <unk> their delicious apples for greater eye appeal 
 still mr. <unk> points out <unk> became popular without big red looks so why not fujis 
 he sees a shift in american values at least regarding apples toward more emphasis on substance and less on <unk> 
 taste has finally come to the <unk> he says

 federal credit programs date back to the new deal and were meant to break even financially 
 since the 1950s federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume subsidy rates and policy applications spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget <unk> and deceptive management in particular 
 as we will see many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit 
 but recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control 
 student loan defaults remain high at about N N and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and <unk> 
 farmers home administration <unk> loans have turned into de <unk> <unk> programs losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ N billion 
 defaults on veterans affairs loan guarantees have <unk> in the past eight years 
 last month the general accounting office reported that defaults in federal housing administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated and that fha 's equity fell to minus $ N billion 
 <unk> 's findings are particularly troubling because the fha has about $ N billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs 
 scores of other credit programs subsidizing agriculture small business exporters defense energy transportation and others are less visible but in no better shape 
 if the programs continue their present path the potential government losses are staggering the federal government holds $ N billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ N billion in primary guarantees 
 secondary guarantees of pools of fha and <unk> loans by the agency known as ginnie mae currently exceed $ N billion 
 although external events have contributed to the <unk> the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs 
 to reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide credit policy must N use credit to improve the operation of capital markets not to provide subsidies 
 there is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program 
 if the program is meant to provide a subsidy collecting the debt <unk> the original goal 
 thus subsidized loans tend to turn into <unk> programs with increasing subsidy and default rates over time 
 to avoid this problem government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect 
 in contrast credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets 
 for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once <unk> the supply of credit to the agricultural sector 
 farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a <unk> flow of <unk> funds 
 however this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans 
 credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy 
 for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and <unk> problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral 
 the program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount 
 high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high 
 families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates 
 in contrast a student loan program that was meant solely to correct <unk> <unk> would allow loans for any student regardless of family income at market or <unk> rates 
 while the student was in school interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance 
 this program combined with cash grants to <unk> students would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries 
 N provide better incentives 
 given the structure of most credit programs it is surprising that default rates are not even higher 
 guarantee rates are typically N N giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully 
 reducing those rates moderately say to N N would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers 
 but it would also encourage lenders to choose more <unk> customers and go a long way toward reducing defaults 
 for example the small business administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lenders ' program 
 borrowers ' incentives are equally <unk> 
 since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the <unk> of <unk> are usually low 
 in addition it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off 
 simple policy <unk> in this case would be to improve debt collection taking the <unk> off contracted collection agencies and to deny new credit to <unk> 
 these provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market <unk> 
 N record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget 
 since the budget measures cash flow a new $ N direct loan is treated as a $ N expenditure even though at least part of the loan will be paid back 
 loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the <unk> defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government 
 by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit 
 predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by $ N billion since N while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ N billion 
 the true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government 
 this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners without federal guarantees 
 neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which <unk> the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ N billion annually according to the congressional budget office 
 a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress is committing them to 
 N impose standard accounting and administrative practices 
 creative accounting is a <unk> of federal credit 
 many agencies roll over their debt paying off <unk> loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans 
 in any case they avoid having to write off the loans 
 some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books as late as N the <unk> bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to cuba in the 1950s 
 more seriously <unk> has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value 
 until <unk> 's recent audit fha books had not been subject to a complete external audit in N years 
 the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits 
 establishing these practices would permit earlier <unk> of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and <unk> decisions and reduce fraud 
 government lending was not intended to be a way to <unk> spending figures hide fraudulent activity or provide large subsidies 
 the reforms described above would provide a more limited but <unk> safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender 
 without such reforms credit programs will continue to be a large-scale high-risk proposition for taxpayers

 president bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority 
 mr. bush has long <unk> for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would <unk> give him a line-item veto which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill 
 he has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending 
 but some analysts particularly conservative legal scholars have urged mr. bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to <unk> that the constitution already <unk> gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto 
 such an <unk> most likely would bring about a court challenge from congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power 
 white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirming comments made this week by vice president dan quayle said mr. bush is interested in finding a suitable test case

 but it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved 
 the u.s. plan also would ease the transition to <unk> agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert <unk> barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over N years 
 trade representative carla hills who along with agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> unveiled the proposal said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the u.s. 's trading partners 
 mr. <unk> seeking to <unk> european objections to an earlier u.s. plan that called for eliminating all <unk> barriers by the year N said the new u.s. proposal would n't put farmers out of business but would only encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants

 another u.s. proposal filed monday urges more fair play in services trade including predictable and clear rules and <unk> in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies 
 unlike the earlier u.s. <unk> proposal which struck european countries as too extreme the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver 
 for instance the new u.s. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which gatt members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition 
 it also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports 
 instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies as the earlier u.s. proposal did the new package calls for the elimination of only the most <unk> ones 
 less <unk> ones would be subject only to some restraints and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions 
 the new u.s. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> 
 the goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the european community 's current attempt to bar imports of beef from <unk> u.s. cattle

 excluding the gain p&g 's earnings were close to analysts ' predictions of about $ N a share for the quarter 
 wall street had expected a modest rise in the company 's domestic sales and earnings and more substantial increases in overseas results 
 one factor helping sales and earnings was a N N price rise for most p&g products except coffee analysts said 
 unit volume or amount of products shipped rose about N N in the international segment with p&g continuing to win market share in japan 's diaper and detergent markets 
 jay <unk> analyst with kidder peabody & co. said p&g 's always <unk> <unk> sold under the <unk> name in japan has firmly established itself as a leading brand 
 he figures p&g will expand its <unk> product line in japan to continue that momentum 
 p&g 's u.s. shipments were up just N N partly because the company decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to the fiscal second quarter

 also slowing growth in the u.s. were lackluster results for p&g 's cooking oils which had a strong year-earlier first quarter

 the voting rights act of N was enacted to keep the promise of the <unk> amendment and enable southern blacks to go to the polls <unk> by <unk> tests and other <unk> devices 
 <unk> years later the voting rights act has been transformed by the courts and the justice department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities hispanics <unk> and native americans holding <unk> office 
 in the 1980s the justice department and lower federal courts that enforce the voting rights act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of safe minority election districts districts where minorities form between N N and N N of the voting population 
 the program has even been called upon to create safe white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority 
 although section N of the act <unk> <unk> requiring that minorities win a <unk> share of <unk> offices few municipal and state government plans achieve <unk> by the justice department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they <unk> out as many <unk> minority districts as possible 
 the new goal of the voting rights act more minorities in political office is <unk> 
 for the political process to work all citizens regardless of race must feel represented 
 one essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency 
 as is blacks constitute N N of the population but fewer than N N of elected leaders 
 but racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal 
 it is a quick fix for a complex problem 
 far from promoting a <unk> of interests among black white hispanic and other minority voters drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important <unk> 
 such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one 
 examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities new york and birmingham <unk> 
 when they <unk> their districts after the N census every other <unk> and state in the country will face this issue 
 new york city 
 racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in new york city since N when congress first amended the voting rights act to expand its reach beyond the southern states 
 in N the justice department required that the electoral <unk> in the borough of brooklyn be <unk> to concentrate black and hispanic votes despite protests that the new electoral <unk> would split a neighborhood of <unk> <unk> into two different districts 
 this year a commission appointed by the mayor to revise new york 's system of government completed a new charter expanding the city council to N from N members 
 sometime in N as soon as the N census becomes available a <unk> panel will <unk> the city council district lines 
 the charter revision commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the justice department and the commission 's own commitment to <unk> minority political leadership the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of <unk> minority districts 
 blacks and hispanics currently make up N N of the city 's population and hold only N N of the seats on the council 
 several of the city 's black leaders including democratic mayoral <unk> david dinkins have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and hispanics the <unk> opportunity for representation 
 in this connection it is important to note that several members of new york 's sitting city council represent <unk> districts that bring together sizable black hispanic and <unk> white <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> district in northern manhattan and the south bronx and susan alter 's <unk> district in brooklyn for example 
 to win their seats on the council these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all 
 often they have found that the relevant issue is not race but rather housing crime prevention or education 
 birmingham ala. 
 the unusual situation in birmingham <unk> illustrates the divisive consequences of <unk> out safe districts for racial minorities 
 in birmingham which is N N black whites are the minority 
 insisting that they are protected by the voting rights act a group of whites brought a federal suit in N to demand that the city abandon <unk> voting for the nine member city council and create nine electoral districts including four safe white districts 
 the white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented because in <unk> elections only black candidates or white candidates who <unk> to black interests could win 
 no federal court has ruled that the voting rights act protects a white minority but in june the justice department approved a <unk> plan for birmingham that <unk> out three <unk> districts and six <unk> districts 
 richard <unk> birmingham 's black mayor <unk> the consequences 
 in the past people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to <unk> blacks or whites he said 
 now you go to districts you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme white and black on racial issues 
 two hundred years ago critics of the new united states constitution warned that the electoral districts for congress were too large and <unk> too many different economic interests 
 a small farmer and a <unk> merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman they said 
 but james madison <unk> that argument in one of the most <unk> political <unk> ever written no. N of the <unk> papers 
 madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good 
 large <unk> election districts would encourage good government said madison because a representative would be <unk> to serve the interests of all his constituents and be <unk> to none 
 madison 's noble and <unk> vision of the representative still can guide us 
 as long as we believe that all americans of every race and ethnic background have common interests and can live together <unk> our political <unk> should reflect our belief 
 racial gerrymandering creating separate black and white districts says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people 
 ms. <unk> is a constitutional scholar at the center for the study of the presidency in new york 
 the justice department has distributed these new guidelines for u.s. attorneys <unk> rico cases 
 a related editorial appears today 
 under rico the government may seek a temporary <unk> order tro upon the filing of a rico indictment in order to preserve all <unk> assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered 
 such orders can have a <unk> impact on third parties who do business with the defendants including clients vendors banks investors creditors dependents and others 
 some highly publicized cases involving rico <unk> have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial <unk> of assets is <unk> to a seizure of property without due process 
 in order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected the criminal division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of <unk> in rico prosecutions 
 it should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements such as review by the asset forfeiture office 
 N as part of the approval process for rico prosecutions the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture tro for review by the organized crime and racketeering section 
 the prosecutor must show that <unk> <unk> such as bonds are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction 
 N in seeking approval of a tro the prosecutor must <unk> any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the tro would have on innocent third parties balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets 
 N in deciding whether forfeiture and hence a tro is appropriate the section will consider the nature and <unk> of the <unk> the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 the division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or at the latest at the first proceeding before the court concerning the tro 
 sales of north <unk> cars and trucks plunged N N in mid-october from a year earlier as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year 
 people are waiting for new factory <unk> said ben <unk> sales manager of bob <unk> auto world in lynn mass. whose sales are slow 
 this trend appears to be especially true at general motors corp. which used both dealer and consumer incentives to <unk> sales in august and september 
 since then deliveries have slumped 
 gm 's car sales dropped N N in mid-october to N while truck sales fell N N to N 
 gm also had dismal results in the first N days of the month while other auto makers reported mixed results 
 all of the big three suffered in the <unk> period however with sales of all domestically made cars including those built at <unk> plants falling N N to N from a year earlier 
 the seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles a small improvement from the N million rate of early october but a big drop from the N million rate a year ago 
 sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-october dropping N N to N from a year ago 
 the big three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans N N below year-ago levels but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve 
 industry analyst john h. <unk> a vice president with hill & <unk> in st. louis forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a <unk> supply of cars at the end of the year even if car sales improve to a N million vehicle rate for the quarter 
 ford motor co. reported a N N drop in sales of <unk> cars to N and a N N drop in domestic trucks to N 
 the sales are being dragged down by a <unk> of N vehicles said joel <unk> a ford analyst

 business had been fairly strong until hurricane hugo hit the area but has been down since 
 chrysler corp. also hit the rocks in mid-october 
 the no. N u.s. auto maker had a N N plunge in car sales to N and a N N drop in truck sales to N which include its minivans and <unk> 
 honda motor co. which continues to have short supplies of domestically made accords saw its sales of north <unk> cars fall N N to N 
 but sales of domestic cars and trucks at nissan motor corp. rose N N to N 
 a nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales 
 toyota motor corp. which opened a plant in <unk> ky. last year saw sales triple to N vehicles

 short interest in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose N N as of mid-october its biggest jump since N N last april 
 the most recent otc short interest statistics were compiled oct. N the day the nasdaq composite index slid N N and the new york stock exchange tumbled N N 
 the <unk> might lead to the conclusion that <unk> bet heavily on that day that otc stocks would decline further 
 as it happens the nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge 
 however the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the national association of securities dealers include only those trades completed or settled by oct. N rather than trades that occurred on that day according to gene <unk> chief economist for the nasd 
 generally it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade 
 the total short interest in nasdaq stocks as of mid-october was N million shares up from N million in september but well below the record level of N million shares established in july N 
 the sharp rise in otc short interest compares with the N N decline in short interest on the new york stock exchange and the N N rise on the american stock exchange during the <unk> period 
 generally a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold 
 short interest which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced can be a <unk> barometer for many stocks 
 among N of the largest otc issues short interest rose to N million shares from N million in N stocks in september 
 big stocks with large short interest gains as of oct. N included first executive intel campeau and lin broadcasting 
 short interest in first executive an insurance issue rose N N to N million 
 intel 's short interest jumped N N while campeau 's increased N N 
 intel makes semiconductors and campeau operates department-store chains and is <unk> for cash 
 <unk> savings again had the dubious honor of being the otc stock with the biggest short interest position on nasdaq 
 <unk> has headed the list since may 
 first executive and troubled valley national corp. of arizona were next in line 
 short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market 
 <unk> shares must eventually be replaced through buying 
 in addition changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage 
 for example an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and <unk> the stock of the other 
 two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge 
 short interest in the american depositary receipts of jaguar the target of both ford motor and general motors more than doubled 
 nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included adobe systems class a shares of tele-communications and takeover targets <unk> and <unk>

 short interest in N <unk> securities totaled N million shares compared with almost N million shares in N issues in september 
 the october short interest represents N days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period compared with N day a month ago 
 among bigger otc stocks the figures represent N days of average daily volume compared with N days in september

 what defeated general aoun was not only the weight of the syrian army 
 the weight of lebanon 's history was also against him and it is a history israel is in danger of <unk> 
 like lebanon and however unfairly israel is regarded by the arab world as a colonial <unk> 
 its best hope of acceptance by its <unk> lies in reaching a settlement with the <unk> 
 like lebanon israel is being <unk> by <unk> 
 in greater israel more than half the children under six are <unk> 
 within N years <unk> will probably be the minority 
 yet israel will neither share power with all these arabs nor says its present prime minister <unk> its borders closer to its <unk> jewish <unk> 
 by not choosing one of these options <unk> will condemn themselves as the <unk> did to perpetual war with the <unk> in their midst and so to the internal erosion of their state 
 unlike the <unk> israel 's <unk> will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private <unk> <unk> will become <unk> before it becomes <unk>

 the nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling <unk> and closed down N N

 the market started with several strikes against it said peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of ual corp. continued to <unk> and reports that the junk-bond market is <unk> 
 but the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market mr. dapuzzo said 
 even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during <unk> <unk> he said when the market does recover the damage is done and it leaves nasdaq down more than the big board 
 mr. dapuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors 
 while shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes mr. dapuzzo acknowledged 
 the volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders too 
 they do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically 
 market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur 
 that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers <unk> they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will 
 in such an environment a market maker can absorb huge losses 
 but the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to <unk> up the stocks that are for sale 
 the market makers say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly 
 the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly <unk> the rise and fall in stock prices during <unk> trading 
 <unk> robert <unk> head of over-the-counter trading at donaldson lufkin & jenrette it 's making it tough for traders to make money

 we 're happy we guess to receive confirmation of the krasnoyarsk violation from the soviets five years after we started writing about it 
 perhaps even the american <unk> will now <unk> 
 without question something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the politburo 
 as it bids for new agreements new loans and indeed admission to the <unk> world the soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem 
 so after N years it is <unk> the obvious hoping to be believed about other things 
 it 's not enough 
 if the soviets want to be believed they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious 
 our own test of glasnost 's <unk> would be a soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling <unk> in u.s.-soviet relations the reported N anthrax <unk> at a soviet military facility in sverdlovsk 
 the u.s. government has never <unk> in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there and hence a violation of the N biological weapons convention 
 the pentagon 's recently issued soviet military power though in general adopting a softer line repeated the sverdlovsk assessment 
 it also was detailed in congressional testimony this past february an explosion at the <unk> and <unk> institute in sverdlovsk released anthrax <unk> that caused a significant number of deaths 
 since mr. shevardnadze did not address this topic before the supreme soviet the soviet union 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat 
 we doubt this claim just as we <unk> mr. shevardnadze 's assurance last year that krasnoyarsk did n't violate the abm treaty 
 and just as we did not believe the <unk> claims of the congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited krasnoyarsk we are in no way persuaded by the <unk> to the <unk> theory by a u.s. team of scientists who met with soviet counterparts in washington last year 
 the soviets ' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the <unk> of cattle that <unk> on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax <unk> 
 harvard 's <unk> <unk> who we read has sold something called the scientific community on the notion that yellow rain attacks on the <unk> <unk> were in fact the result of <unk> <unk> by giant <unk> found the soviet anthrax scenario completely <unk> 
 we do n't believe it 
 and we certainly do not believe that mr. gorbachev or any of his <unk> yet deserve to have the west take their word for it 
 sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself 
 the u.s. government 's sverdlovsk complaint as with krasnoyarsk is no mere political <unk> 
 biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the u.s. government 
 but the stated u.s. position is detailed and specific and the prospect of biological <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 the soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that sverdlovsk violated the N agreement or alternatively that would give u.s. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident 
 until that happens glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility mr. shevardnadze was bidding for with his <unk> on monday 
 manville corp. said it offered to buy $ N million of its convertible preferred stock from the manville personal injury settlement trust in a move that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of manville shares outstanding 
 manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value

 manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made

 we need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries 
 the trust created as part of manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of <unk> diseases owns N million of the series a convertible preferred shares which are each convertible into N manville common shares

 in addition to the stock and N N of manville 's profits beginning in N the trust is supposed to receive $ N billion over its <unk> life 
 but it initially was funded with about $ N million and may soon face a cash crunch 
 as of june N it had settled about N of N claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ N million a large portion of its $ N million in cash and <unk> securities 
 since most of its assets are tied to manville a forest and building products concern the trust might also want to diversify its holdings

 a manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes

 it wo n't be cheaper 
 we sell direct 
 a heavy <unk> woman runs a handful through her fingers and counts him out a pile of <unk> 
 country people breed pigs says mr. <unk> <unk> against the back of his truck 
 they ca n't buy feed from the state 
 there is n't enough 
 some state middlemen come to buy from me 
 i sell a little 
 i am waiting 
 i have plenty more at home 
 on this morning he does n't sell much in <unk> either 
 at closing time farmers <unk> out most of what they <unk> in 
 a private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business 
 the <unk> of <unk> it seems will not quickly <unk> away 
 state monopolies will keep on <unk> trade free prices or not until something else <unk> them 
 polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement processing and distribution plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with <unk> pesticides <unk> and feed 
 the communists spent N years working to ensure that no such <unk> structures ever arose here 
 building them now will require <unk> from the west and removal of political <unk> a job that solidarity has barely started 
 but polish agriculture does <unk> one great asset already the private farmer 
 we are dealing with real entrepreneurs says <unk> <unk> an economist who advises rural solidarity the union 's <unk> <unk> 
 there are a lot of them and they have property 
 polish peasants <unk> the <unk> were once a source of shame to orthodox communists 
 now among communist reformers they are <unk> of envy 
 food is the <unk> 's top priority the key to popular support 
 as the chinese have shown and the soviets are learning family farms <unk> where <unk> fail 
 ownership it seems is the best fertilizer 
 the poles have had it all along 
 poland 's N million small private farms cover N N of its <unk> land 
 on it a quarter of the country 's N million people produce <unk> of its grain beef eggs and milk and <unk> of its fruit <unk> and potatoes 
 like the roman catholic church the polish peasant is a <unk> of the nation 
 try as they might the communists could neither replace nor break him 
 and they did try 
 a few miles past <unk> a <unk> road narrows to a track of sand and leads into <unk> a village of <unk> farms 
 <unk> <unk> owns N acres in N scattered <unk> 
 he grows <unk> and potatoes for a few <unk> five <unk> and N <unk> 
 in <unk> <unk> and torn shoes he stands in his <unk> <unk> the ground with a look both <unk> and <unk> 
 it 's bad soil he says 
 until N it was good soil 
 then the state put in a <unk> to supply the area with drinking water 
 farmers lay down before the <unk> 
 their protest was ignored 
 the dam caused the water level to drop in <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> and his <unk> <unk> 
 he expected as much 
 in his lifetime N years the communists brought electricity to his village and <unk> in drinking water from the <unk> 
 no phones 
 no gas 
 we wanted them to build a road here he says 
 they started and then abandoned it 
 a <unk> his only <unk> equipment stands in front of the <unk> 
 it 's russian 
 good for nothing 
 parts are a tragedy 
 even if i had a lot of money i could n't buy what i need 
 the farmer can say the same for coal cement saw <unk> 
 in poland only N N of all investment goes toward making things farmers want in the west it is closer to N N 
 the few big state farms take first crack at what does get made 
 they use N N more fertilizer per <unk> twice the high-grade feed 
 yet their best <unk> is that they produce N N of polish pork 
 i 've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized mr. <unk> says as his wife <unk> sets some chairs out in the sun 
 we have one near here 
 there is a lot of waste 
 a private farmer never <unk> anything 
 the state quit <unk> peasants onto its subsidized farms over N years ago 
 but it never did let up on the pressure 
 until recently a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension 
 the pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state 
 his <unk> of materials also did until the state could n't hold up its end of that bargain 
 yet the state alone sells seeds and machines 
 when supplies are short it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain 
 a private farmer in poland is free to buy and sell land hire help decide what to grow and how to grow it 
 he is free to invest in <unk> and to fail for lack of chicken wire 
 he has plenty of freedom but no choices 
 i 'm on my own land mr. <unk> says 
 i do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do 
 sometimes says his wife we 're happy about that 
 by <unk> the peasant the communists have <unk> poland 
 <unk> like <unk> exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors 
 farm income is N N below the average 
 the young leave especially <unk> who wo n't milk <unk> by hand 
 some men stay their best friend a bottle of <unk> but two million acres have gone <unk> 
 without machines good farms ca n't get bigger 
 so the potato crop once N million tons is down to N million 
 meat consumption is at N 's level pork production at N 's milk output at N 's 
 if a food crisis <unk> the communists a food revolution will make solidarity 
 the potential is displayed along every road into warsaw row upon row of <unk> stretching out behind modern <unk> that <unk> their owners ' wealth 
 <unk> are abundant and full of flavor in poland the <unk> and <unk> <unk> the state monopolies long broken 
 grain milk and meat come next 
 a private challenge to the <unk> <unk> industry will take more time and money than poland can spare although a <unk> or a local dairy can spring up fast 
 poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale 
 solidarity wants it from the west 
 maria <unk> one of its farm experts <unk> it on the line the world bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system 
 <unk> <unk> is destroying it now 
 he <unk> pork 
 a law went on the books in january that let him smoke <unk> without breeding pigs 
 he <unk> in 
 poland is short on enterprises not enterprise 
 i pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees he says 
 he is in warsaw to open a shop 
 i hire transportation and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day 
 i do n't subsidize anyone 
 everyone around me lives well 
 yes my prices are high 
 if nobody buys i bring my prices down 
 that 's the rule 
 that 's the market 
 mr. <unk> is making a fortune $ N a month he says 
 he has bought some trendy western clothes and a green mercedes with an american flag in the window 
 but the <unk> machines he picked up are N years old 
 i do n't want expensive machines 
 if the situation changes i 'll get stuck with them 
 that 's politics 
 by taking power in a deal with the peasant party 's <unk> communist <unk> solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur 
 rural solidarity <unk> to no <unk> when solidarity leader <unk> <unk> accepted the peasants ' support 
 it <unk> again in september when prime minister <unk> <unk> <unk> named a peasant party man as his agriculture minister 
 both the peasants and rural solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers 
 the peasants can make a credible case against solidarity that <unk> reform will drive millions from the land 
 next spring the two will battle in local elections 
 but until then and probably long afterward the communists ' <unk> of <unk> from the head of the dairy <unk> to the village bank manager will stay planted in the polish <unk> 
 we know how to get from capitalism to socialism <unk> <unk> is saying one afternoon 
 we do n't know how to get from socialism to capitalism 
 he farms N acres in <unk> two miles from the soviet border in one of poland 's poorest places 
 now he is mounting the steps of a <unk> building in a nearby village on a visit to the communist administrator the naczelnik 
 many people in poland hope this government will break down says mr. <unk> who belongs to the local council and to rural solidarity 
 that 's what the naczelnik counts on 
 he is our most dangerous enemy 
 every time he sees me he gets very nervous 
 the farmer <unk> into the naczelnik 's office 
 a thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper 
 mr. <unk> sits 
 <unk> <unk> 's leg begins <unk> beneath his desk 
 solidarity does n't care for the good of this region he says after a few <unk> 
 they want to turn everything upside down in a week 
 mr. <unk> here wants N acres used at the moment by a state farm 
 he ca n't guarantee that he can use it any better 
 i am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm 
 the naczelnik <unk> his eyes 
 what have you got 
 not even a <unk> 
 and you want to make <unk> baskets too 
 i can do five things at once to be a businessman 
 big business mr. <unk> <unk> in english 
 the farmer stands to go 
 the naczelnik stands too 
 i care very much for this post he says 
 eight years i 've had it 
 a cultural center has been built shops 
 suddenly i am not a comfortable man for solidarity 
 i have accomplished too much 
 they want to do more 
 i wish them all the best 
 the farmer leaves 
 and the naczelnik <unk> his door 
 the house approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake 
 the N roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance but the cost to the treasury is sure to <unk> budget pressures this year and next under the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law 
 by a <unk> N margin the chamber rejected an effort to waive gramm-rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal N deficit by at least $ N billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by congress 
 the budget impact will be greater still in fiscal N and the issue forced a confrontation between the appropriations committee leadership and budget committee chairman leon <unk> whose california district was at the center of the earthquake last week 
 going to the well of the chamber mr. <unk> demanded the costs be fully counted 
 his prominent role put him in the <unk> position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead 
 we do not come to this house asking for any <unk> said the california democrat 
 we do not intend to hide these costs from the american people 
 the $ N billion package <unk> $ N million for <unk> disaster loans $ N billion in highway construction funds and $ N billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to president bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters 
 the funds are in addition to $ N billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from hugo bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $ N billion in unanticipated spending 
 because of the <unk> of gramm-rudman the immediate impact is relatively small 
 but the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal N 
 within the appropriations process the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those <unk> that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget 
 the underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight and this urgency has contributed to the speed and critics say mistakes that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance 
 the hastily drafted measure could hurt california by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required 
 and the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ N million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year 
 also the high price of san francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more <unk> to the national average 
 for example disaster loans which will go to small businesses and homeowners offer credit as low as N N in some cases 
 but the san francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $ N from $ N to assist the hard hit but often wealthy marina district 
 the senate is expected to make some modifications today but both the white house and congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight 's deadline 
 administration pressure <unk> any effort to add to total funding and the senate changes are expected to be largely technical dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total small business administration loans to $ N billion to accommodate the increased activity expected 
 yesterday 's floor action came as a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion fiscal N military construction bill representing a N N reduction from last year and making severe cuts from pentagon requests for installations abroad 
 an estimated $ N million is allocated to continue work in <unk> 
 but all funding is cut for the philippines and projects in south korea are cut to $ N million or less than a sixth of the administration 's request 
 closer to home the negotiators were more generous 
 an estimated $ N million was set aside for military installations in the home state of north carolina rep. <unk> <unk> the house chairman 
 and $ N million would go to projects in tennessee represented by his senate counterpart and fellow democrat sen. james <unk> 
 texas and california are traditionally powerful within the conference but equally striking is the dominance of alaska pennsylvania and west virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process 
 senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd d. <unk> even added report language listing $ N million in projects he wants in the budget next year 
 no individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than sen. daniel inouye d. hawaii who chairs the senate defense subcommittee 
 in the final trading the house was <unk> on setting aside $ N million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal N 
 but it gave ground to mr. inouye on a number of projects ranging from a $ N million parking garage here to a land transfer in hawaii to a provision to assist the <unk> indian tribe in washington state 
 the tribe is one of the poorest in the pacific northwest 
 mr. inouye who chairs the select committee on indian affairs used his power to move $ N from the air force to the bureau of indian affairs to assist in <unk> a <unk> base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center 
 meanwhile house-senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $ N billion anti-drug and <unk> <unk> cutting other federal spending N N to pay for it 
 a formal house-senate conference is expected to <unk> the accord later this week 
 mobil corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the u.s. possibly as soon as next month say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy 
 the size of the cuts is n't known but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division which is responsible for <unk> oil reserves drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas 
 employees have n't yet been notified 
 sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for friday at mobil offices in new orleans and denver 
 this would be a second round of cuts by mobil which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by N N to N N during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide <unk> 
 mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic <unk> operations 
 in yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report the company <unk> to a $ N million provision for restructuring costs involving u.s. exploration and production operations 
 the report says that the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will <unk> involve the transfer and termination of employees in our u.s. operations 
 a company spokesman reached at his home last night would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week 
 most oil companies including mobil have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses 
 individuals familiar with mobil 's strategy say that mobil is reducing its u.s. work force because of declining u.s. output 
 yesterday mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ N million loss in the third quarter while comparable foreign operations earned $ N million 
 industrywide oil production in this country fell by N barrels a day to N million barrels in the first eight months of this year 
 daily output is expected to decline by at least another N barrels next year 
 some mobil executives were <unk> that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified 
 one mobil executive said that the $ N million charge related to the action indicates a substantial number of people will be involved 
 some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations 
 the justice department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal judge david <unk> recently called a monster 
 <unk> to say he was talking about rico 
 with its recently revised guidelines for rico justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors 
 the text of the new policy guidelines from the criminal division are <unk> nearby 
 they strongly suggest that justice 's prosecutions of drexel burnham lambert michael <unk> and <unk> violated <unk> of fundamental fairness 
 justice is attempting to avoid a <unk> of these tactics 
 this amounts to an extraordinary <unk> of the tenure of new york mayoral candidate and former u.s. attorney rudolph giuliani who was more inclined to gathering <unk> than understanding markets 
 the new guidelines limit the pretrial <unk> of assets of <unk> defendants and their investors clients bankers and others 
 this follows earlier new guidelines from the tax division <unk> <unk> tax cases from <unk> as rico cases 
 the forfeiture memo cited considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial <unk> of assets is <unk> to a seizure of property without due process 
 it told prosecutors not to seek <unk> if there are less <unk> alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek <unk> disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 these changes come a <unk> late for <unk> the first <unk> securities firm 
 it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors <unk> their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture 
 <unk> investors including <unk> & co. and the harvard <unk> made the rational decision to withdraw their money for the firm the liquidation was sentence first verdict later 
 prosecutors wanted $ N million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ N 
 the experience of <unk> and <unk> of other <unk> cases against legitimate businesses taught drexel that a <unk> investment bank would be an <unk> bank 
 drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges which the company is not in a position to dispute because of rico 
 part of drexel 's plea was to cut mr. <unk> loose 
 so after all the prosecutorial <unk> no one has established what if anything drexel did wrong 
 so two <unk> for the new rules 
 justice has finally recognized its employees ' abuses thanks largely to the demands for reform by former u.s. attorney in washington joseph <unk> who wants to salvage rico for real criminals 
 but prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at justice is willing and able to <unk> <unk> prosecutors 
 judge <unk> of the appeals court in washington made this point at a <unk> institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled rico the monster that <unk> <unk> 
 he said <unk> is supposed to be a government of laws not of men and yet rico defenders tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against <unk> of rico 
 no prosecutorial guidelines observed or <unk> limit civil rico cases by plaintiffs for damages 
 what now for <unk> officials drexel and mr. <unk> 
 justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred 
 we suspect that justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of rico can guarantee an end to <unk> in its name 
 the famous teddy z which cbs inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule is n't turning out to be the hit the network <unk> 
 although the half-hour situation comedy seen <unk> at N p.m eastern and pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation it is slated for <unk> and by next week the network may announce teddy z is moving to N p.m. from its N time <unk> replacing the people next door which became the first network show to be canceled this season 
 teddy z which centers on a <unk> <unk> agent at a hollywood talent agency was scheduled in the <unk> N p.m. <unk> to follow murphy brown a situation comedy about a television news magazine <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 teddy z was boosted by favorable reviews and a <unk> promotional <unk> contest with k mart corp 
 it was <unk> on cable services including <unk> <unk> at night and <unk> and <unk> as the no. <unk> show for the week 
 but five weeks after the premiere the series has <unk> 
 in figures released yesterday by a.c. nielsen co teddy z produced by the television unit of columbia pictures entertainment inc. was in <unk> place 
 worse every week it <unk> audience <unk> from murphy brown and <unk> on cbs picks up again once teddy z is over and is followed by designing women 
 there is strong indication that teddy z is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding said john <unk> senior vice president at j. walter thompson co. a unit of wpp group plc 
 last week murphy brown was viewed by N N of the available television households while the number dropped to N N for teddy z and rose to N N for designing women 
 cbs executives said the program is also slated to <unk> some plot changes 
 <unk> <unk> wilson for example included the lead character 's <unk> family in the cast but that is not the right focus anymore said one cbs executive 
 instead cbs hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent 
 we 're making adjustments on the show yes but nothing radical said craig nelson the story consultant on teddy z 
 but we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family 
 the opening credits are being <unk> mr. nelson said to make teddy 's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning 
 those viewers find the show confusing 
 the stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors 
 prices of long-term treasury bonds moved <unk> to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening 
 but the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies 
 the bond market got an early boost from the <unk> sell-off in stocks 
 that rout was triggered by ual corp. 's announcement late monday that the proposed <unk> buy-out had collapsed 
 the <unk> decline in the dow jones industrial average during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to treasury bonds 
 at its strongest the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point or more than $ N for each $ N face amount 
 as the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day bond prices retreated 
 but analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly <unk> orders and lackluster mid-october auto sales helped <unk> up the treasury market 
 a slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices 
 on the surface the decline in september durable goods only N N did n't appear very weak 
 but orders for <unk> capital goods a <unk> of future plant and equipment spending were off N N after falling N N in august 
 auto makers reported that mid-october sales were running at an annual rate of about N million units far less than the N million units analysts had expected 
 taken together the <unk> and <unk> reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is <unk> down 
 although analysts do n't expect the federal reserve to ease credit policy soon reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates 
 now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's october employment report as potentially prompting the fed to lower rates 
 the stock market 's <unk> drop frightened foreign investors who quickly bid the dollar lower 
 but as stock prices recovered some of the early losses so did the u.s. currency 
 although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the u.s. economy <unk> the dollar ended down only modestly 
 in major market activity bond prices rose 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained nearly half a point or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the yield on the issue slipped to N N 
 the dollar retreated 
 in late new york trading the currency was quoted at N marks and N yen compared with N marks and N yen monday 
 <unk> of the rich and famous may be visiting some new <unk> in the near future

 miss <unk> <unk> her <unk> fear of <unk> <unk> 
 mr. bakker said he was guilty of <unk> but not fraud 
 we can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be america 's celebrity <unk> 
 boeing co. said trans european airways ordered a dozen N <unk> valued at a total of about $ N million 
 the N and N series aircraft will be <unk> by engines jointly produced by general electric co. and <unk> of france 
 currently boeing has a backlog of about $ N billion but production has been slowed by a strike of N machinists which entered its <unk> day today 
 last week a mediator failed to <unk> talks between the company and the <unk> who have rejected a pay raise offer of N N over three years 
 when the good <unk> assigned to <unk> <unk> over the <unk> of <unk> <unk> many years ago in <unk> she <unk> her with high e <unk> <unk> <unk> clean <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> as magic dust 
 maybe she could drop by at the metropolitan opera and bring along what she <unk> a little <unk> a few <unk> of <unk> skills and a nice <unk> 
 cast as violetta <unk> in a new production of <unk> 's la <unk> ms. <unk> last week did many things <unk> and others not so well 
 it is n't every day that we hear a violetta who can <unk> the first act 's <unk> music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly <unk> together 
 never once did she <unk> for air or <unk> her <unk> 
 she was as cool as a <unk> 
 but as you may know things are not going well for violetta 
 there are times when she must show a little <unk> 
 she has <unk> after all and a <unk> <unk> and though a successful <unk> she is just about <unk> at the bank 
 worse her walls move all the time at least in this production 
 just when ms. <unk> sat down away from her guests to cough in private her salon began sliding around the stage her country <unk> also has a very active set of <unk> 
 hold on to those funny <unk> you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more 
 this is the most moving <unk> i 've ever seen 
 normally violetta can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as <unk> as the <unk> 
 but this is a production designed and directed by franco <unk> and paid for by <unk> <unk> who has no need to count her pennies unlike violetta down to N louis at the opera 's end 
 seeing all those millions in action i was just so relieved that ms. <unk> <unk> thing that she is did n't <unk> <unk> herself in a <unk> 
 large and <unk> <unk> is another addition to the met 's growing stock of <unk> productions mostly by mr. <unk> 
 they have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast is n't up to either 
 if a strike ever hits the met the company can still sell tickets to his <unk> and <unk> and boom out <unk> of another era 
 last week 's <unk> audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the <unk> neil <unk> who sang an <unk> inside it 
 <unk> <unk> as a <unk> student <unk> around on <unk> mr. <unk> hardly seemed the fellow to catch a fancy <unk> 's eye 
 i wish he could wear <unk> in his voice 
 not nearly in his best form the <unk> made <unk> sounds along with his usual <unk> hand gestures 
 maybe mr. <unk> was too busy <unk> his set to work with his naturally <unk> <unk> 
 or is it that mr. <unk> is getting a little tired of <unk> 
 this is the same production already seen in paris and <unk> and its <unk> ideas echo the movie he made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 decades earlier maria <unk> sang the dallas staging that introduced the <unk> idea 
 in an <unk> that drives <unk> <unk> <unk> violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude rising <unk> when then she <unk> the great parties she used to throw 
 the entire opera is her dream 
 given the prelude 's <unk> connections with the music preceding the last act the idea is more <unk> than bad though as luck would have it for a change there actually was a <unk> in the pit whom we wanted to hear carlos <unk> trying to make <unk> music while we all waited for the bed <unk> to stir into song 
 once she did so the <unk> german <unk> with the shaky nerves who so often <unk> offered a <unk> flowing performance that in its <unk> and <unk> approach was totally at odds with the staging 
 of <unk> moments there were nearly none and whether this has to do with mr. <unk> or the wooden cast is hard to say 
 in any event ms. <unk> barely <unk> violetta 's <unk> in her long meeting with <unk> <unk> who as <unk> seemed fairly desperate trying to <unk> an <unk> <unk> into his heavy <unk> <unk> 
 di <unk> was n't much of an <unk> for <unk> southern france 
 perhaps mr. <unk> could let him substitute one of the <unk> about dead children and dark nights from <unk> 's <unk> 
 speaking of dark nights the met 's <unk> neighbor the new york city opera has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians who wanted pay parity with the the chicago <unk> and san francisco opera <unk> 
 well they can now go and <unk> there 
 good luck 
 common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market 
 the cancellation <unk> poorly for a company already <unk> with an identity crisis <unk> by the retirement of general director beverly <unk> and the amazing appointment of christopher <unk> as her successor after his years of <unk> <unk> in the pit 
 as the met discovered years ago following a <unk> december opening it is nearly impossible to <unk> subscribers once they have had time to <unk> their entertainment choices 
 i for instance was perfectly happy at avery fisher hall the other day listening to <unk> <unk> conduct the <unk> per <unk> a strange piece written by N different italian <unk> to honor <unk> after his death in N 
 each of them contributed a section at the <unk> of <unk> who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements 
 for all that the piece landed <unk> in a dusty <unk> after bologna refused to supply a chorus and <unk> 
 we know <unk> 's own contribution was mighty impressive since the <unk> <unk> me was <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson 
 the surprising discovery of the evening at fisher was the high standard achieved by some of his <unk> colleagues notably <unk> <unk> 
 his <unk> <unk> was smoothly sung by bass brian matthews 
 also <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> was <unk> scored and <unk> put across by mr. <unk> 
 he brought along his <unk> <unk> <unk> chorus and even better the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 she was in her most <unk> <unk> voice 
 maybe she could step across the plaza to the met where she has still to make her debut and help out her <unk> <unk> by <unk> the slow parts of <unk> 
 the tokyo international film festival was no match for the <unk> film festival in terms of prestige but it made its mark it awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first-time film makers

 by comparison <unk> now gives $ N to the winner of its young director 's award 
 says director george miller mad max i think the tokyo festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition 
 there are <unk>

 belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy shares or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional N belgian francs about $ N for each transaction bringing the total fee to N francs 
 while no figures exist it is thought that many small investors in belgium store securities privately in some cases to avoid paying high <unk> taxes 
 the law could <unk> to the advantage of brokers and banks who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors 
 japan is considering giving aid to hungary and poland to support their recent political reforms a spokesman for the foreign ministry said

 the company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category as well as the intense competition in the company 's <unk> protection product line 
 overseas sales were stronger <unk> because of a rebound in brazil where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results johnson & johnson said 
 mr. <unk> of painewebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing a pattern continuing this quarter 
 he cautioned however that a tough <unk> comparison may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter 
 for last year 's fourth quarter the company 's tax rate was less than N N he said

 four of those insiders sold more than half their holdings 
 the stock in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday closed at $ N up N cents well below the $ N to $ N a share the insiders received for their shares 
 much of the recent slide in dun & bradstreet 's stock came late last week after negative comments by analysts at merrill lynch & co. and goldman sachs & co

 <unk> <unk> used to hold the <unk> belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all 
 now only god exists as a matter of <unk> necessity it is built into his nature 
 but since the time of <unk> we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our <unk> 
 are n't we after all the inevitable culmination of that <unk> <unk> called evolution 
 if <unk> and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life then it was only a matter of <unk> before <unk> beings <unk> with reason <unk> and taste <unk> onto the scene 
 now along comes stephen jay gould to <unk> this <unk> illusion 
 his credentials are excellent for the task 
 star <unk> at harvard author of numerous popular books on science and <unk> of the <unk> lobby mr. gould is perhaps the world 's most <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from <unk> 
 for him natural history is anything but a gradual predictable march from <unk> <unk> to human <unk> it is a <unk> chaotic affair in which the emergence of a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> shot 
 in wonderful life the burgess <unk> and the nature of history norton N pages $ N mr. gould makes his case for the <unk> <unk> of human evolution 
 the argument turns on the discovery in N of an amazing fossil <unk> high in the canadian <unk> called the burgess <unk> 
 here in an area smaller than a city block lay buried <unk> of <unk> weird creatures that had <unk> more than N million years ago creatures whose <unk> variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's <unk> today 
 such an embarrassment of <unk> was <unk> to the man who discovered the burgess <unk> one charles <unk> <unk> 
 the received <unk> wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design limited in scope and <unk> to contemporary <unk> 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> hypothetical <unk> from the burgess <unk> in such a way that they could be <unk> into familiar categories 
 it was not until the early 1970s that cambridge prof. harry whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a <unk> of the burgess <unk> 
 by making <unk> <unk> about how the <unk> and distorted fossil remains <unk> to <unk> structures this <unk> was able to piece together a series of <unk> <unk> quite unlike anything currently on the planet 
 one was so <unk> in appearance it was dubbed <unk> 
 would that mr. gould 's minute <unk> of these creatures was always so <unk> 
 a good deal of the book is boring particularly the endless <unk> to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes <unk> the text 
 these turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like most modern <unk> have six <unk> <unk> on the <unk> 
 interest picks up though when mr. gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the burgess <unk> for the theory of evolution 
 not long after the appearance of life <unk> there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth 
 the vast majority of them however were wiped out by a succession of environmental <unk> that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate 
 consequently the <unk> process was like a <unk> in which each group held a ticket unrelated to its <unk> <unk> 
 so much for survival of the <unk> 
 so much too for the notion that we humans <unk> in the <unk> struggle by <unk> big brains 
 our <unk> <unk> <unk> out through the <unk> impact that did in the <unk> because they were small not smart 
 if anyone has difficulty <unk> a world in which history went <unk> on without us mr. gould <unk> several 
 in one birds are the dominant <unk> in another the <unk> <unk> with little <unk> 
 back when the burgess <unk> were <unk> it seems human <unk> hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a <unk> called <unk> 
 mr. gould finds this oddly <unk> like an <unk> of old he views our <unk> as a source of both freedom and <unk> moral responsibility 
 i by contrast can not help feeling that if some other <unk> from the burgess <unk> had survived instead beings at once <unk> and less <unk> than <unk> <unk> might have eventually gained <unk> dominion 
 but even if no <unk> life had <unk> here at all the universe is a big place and given the right conditions sympathetic to creating some form of life 
 surely at some other <unk> address a <unk> <unk> would have risen out of the <unk> to explain why <unk> speaking it is indeed a wonderful life 
 mr. holt is a columnist for the literary review in london 
 the justice department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law 
 the guidelines were distributed to u.s. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week 
 they discourage prosecutors under certain circumstances from seeking court orders <unk> the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial 
 but david runkel chief justice department spokesman said the guidelines are a <unk> and a <unk> far more than a new direction 
 use of the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law against white-collar defendants as opposed to alleged <unk> figures has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars 
 critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury <unk> they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can <unk> corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains 
 in the new guidelines the justice department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial the government will not seek to disrupt the normal legitimate business activities of the defendant and will not seek to take from third parties assets <unk> transferred to them 
 the guidelines also state the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 another provision <unk> certain limits on when prosecutors may use <unk> charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case 
 mr. runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants 
 the impact if there is any will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use racketeering charges is made in individual cases by justice department officials in washington he said 
 in a memorandum describing the guidelines assistant attorney general edward dennis jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press 
 but mr. runkel said the government is n't backing off on these kinds of matters at all 
 california legislators searching for ways to pay for the $ N billion to $ N billion in damages from last week 's earthquake are laying the <unk> for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax 
 the talk of a sales tax rise follows a <unk> from congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in california 's earthquake relief efforts 
 the state had sought as much as $ N billion in relief but yesterday the house approved a more general <unk> measure calling for $ N billion in aid the bulk of which would go to california with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by hurricane hugo 
 that leaves the state roughly $ N billion to $ N billion short 
 a sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and <unk> to raise funds in a hurry 
 according to the state department of finance a <unk> increase in the state 's <unk> per dollar sales tax could raise $ N billion 
 <unk> brown speaker of california 's assembly said that gov. george deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks 
 california 's so-called <unk> limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency 
 both mr. brown the state 's most influential legislator and gov. deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government 
 according to a spokesman the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes 
 mr. brown meanwhile believes only one tax will be <unk> and it will be a <unk> sales tax increase said chuck <unk> an aide 
 one immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by gov. deukmejian 
 the fund has about $ N billion and is set up to handle precisely the kind of emergency the state faces said tom <unk> the governor 's deputy press secretary 
 but the fund 's size is disputed by mr. brown 's office which estimates the fund holds from $ N million to $ N million 
 moreover an aide to mr. brown said gov. deukmejian has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this 
 to push through a sales tax increase however the state will have to suspend the <unk> limit citing an emergency 
 and then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends said <unk> katz assistant director of the state department of finance 
 a sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state 's legislature 
 but observers expect broad support 
 if there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere i think the attitude will be supportive said kirk west president of the california chamber of commerce 
 but others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief <unk> 
 since the late 1970s california property owners have benefited from a tax <unk> as a result of a state ballot initiative known as proposition N 
 the state could also increase gasoline taxes every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ N million a month 
 but gov. deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis 
 to raise more highway funds a measure to double the state 's <unk> a <unk> tax over five years is set to appear on the state 's june election ballot 
 but some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure 
 not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs 
 it 's possible though not probable that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help said <unk> <unk> chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee 
 separately two men injured in last week 's <unk> freeway collapse in oakland began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately <unk> warnings about the structure 's safety 
 the claims which were filed with the state board of control but will probably end up in court are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called cypress structure <unk> 
 the men can defeat <unk> that states often <unk> in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes 
 a board of control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment

 people start their own businesses for many reasons 
 but a chance to fill out <unk> records is rarely one of them 
 red tape is the <unk> of small business 
 ironically the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active <unk> sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and <unk> demands of federal state and local regulators 
 yet every business owner has to face the <unk> of forms and regulations and often is the only one available to tackle it 
 there is hope of change 
 last week sen. malcolm <unk> r. <unk> held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory <unk> for small businesses 
 a great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses says <unk> jacob a legislative aide to sen. <unk> 
 other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently <unk> <unk> reduction act which many feel benefited small enterprises 
 thus optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape just as soon as uncle sam gets around to arranging it 
 meanwhile they tackle the <unk> of paper and <unk> about a dream world where <unk> postal regulations and government inspectors are <unk> 
 to find out what red tape <unk> entrepreneurs most the journal asked a completely <unk> random sample of business owners to <unk> about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail 
 some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose 
 they concede that much of the government <unk> that <unk> them is essential to the public good and even to their own businesses 
 rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior generally the best regarded form of red tape create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away says <unk> west president of <unk> international inc. a <unk> va. business that designs <unk> and other products 
 mr. west cites the federal communications commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment they monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market 
 some <unk> about red tape are predictable architects complain about a host of building regulations auto leasing companies about car insurance rules 
 determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects says mark <unk> president of <unk> & co. a <unk> mass. architectural firm 
 there is such a <unk> of federal state and local codes that building inspectors are backing away from <unk> them mr. <unk> says 
 taxi leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to <unk> with state insurance laws and a host of agencies 
 it 's very costly and <unk> says phil rosen a partner in fleet & leasing management inc. a boston <unk> company 
 one senior executive at his firm spends nearly N N of his time on insurance he says 
 other forms of red tape are more pervasive 
 the most onerous many entrepreneurs say is the <unk> and filing required by tax authorities 
 <unk> with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second

 trinity rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters still <unk> an annual a christmas carol 
 how would this <unk> of traditional values fare in ms. bogart 's <unk> hands 
 she held her fire with her first production at the trinity earlier this season 
 it was a predictable revival of her <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's theoretical <unk> called no plays no <unk> 
 now with the opening of <unk> gorky 's <unk> <unk> ms. bogart has laid her cards on the table 
 <unk> is a hand that will test the <unk> of her audiences 
 for ms. bogart who initially studied and directed in germany and cites such european directors as peter stein giorgio <unk> and <unk> <unk> as influences tends to stage her productions with a <unk> <unk> whether the text demands it or not 
 and gorky considered the father of soviet socialist <unk> did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately <unk> <unk> techniques 
 gorky was a loyal if occasionally <unk> <unk> writer committed to <unk> the <unk> with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of <unk> <unk> 
 and <unk> <unk> in N as a kind of <unk> to <unk> 's cherry <unk> is a lawn party of russian <unk> engaged in an <unk> ideological fight to the finish between the <unk> and the reformers 
 along the way there also are lots of romantic <unk> 
 <unk> ms. bogart has kept gorky 's time and place intact 
 despite the absence of <unk> and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down the production is rich in russian <unk> voiced by <unk> folk sporting <unk> <unk> and <unk> cotton with <unk> and fishing poles <unk> 
 but beyond this <unk> <unk> to tradition ms. bogart and company head off in a <unk> direction that all but <unk> gorky 's <unk> drama into something <unk> to well <unk> 
 the director 's attempt to force some <unk> distance between her actors and their characters frequently <unk> with performances that are <unk> <unk> 
 not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them but they often literally stand on their heads 
 like peter <unk> ms. bogart <unk> her actors as if they were <unk> <unk> <unk> them on <unk> <unk> them off tables even hanging them from <unk> while having them perform some <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
 there are moments in this <unk> when the characters <unk> the vast <unk> country house which looks like a <unk> of frank lloyd wright and is designed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in

 the clash of <unk> <unk> this treatment but the <unk> and <unk> of gorky 's individual characters have <unk> in the <unk> 
 as for the humor that gorky 's text provides when <unk> in such broad strokes particularly by the lesser members of the <unk> it looks and sounds forced 
 ms. bogart does better with music than with words when she wants as she so often does want to express herself through gorky 's <unk> play 
 here she has the aid of her longtime associate jeff <unk> whom she appointed trinity 's <unk> musical director and whom she equipped with a <unk> new $ N sound system and recording studio 
 for gorky mr. <unk> provided an <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view 
 like <unk> and indeed <unk> pound ms. bogart has said that her intent in such <unk> staging of the <unk> is simply an attempt to make it new 
 indeed during a recent <unk> audience discussion the director explained that her <unk> artistic wish was to find a way to play somewhere over the rainbow so that the song 's original beauty comes through <unk> the <unk> 
 the danger that ms. bogart seems to be <unk> here is one of <unk> rather than <unk> a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view <unk> rather than <unk> each other 
 ms. bogart 's cast is part and parcel of the problem 
 ed shea and barbara <unk> never find a real reason for their love affair as the <unk> <unk> young <unk> and the <unk> humanitarian doctor maria <unk> 
 cynthia <unk> as the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> not the <unk> <unk> gorky intended 
 better to look in the corners for performances that <unk> or <unk>

 homefed corp. said third-quarter net income slid N N to $ N million or $ N per fully diluted share from $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property 
 the decline surprised analysts and jolted homefed 's stock which lost N N of its value closing at $ N on the new york stock exchange down $ N 
 homefed had been one of the handful of large west coast thrifts that in recent quarters had <unk> interest-rate problems <unk> the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the <unk> california housing market 
 analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $ N a share 
 however homefed 's loan <unk> and purchases plunged N N in the quarter to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 meanwhile <unk> assets rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 some $ N million of the troubled assets is <unk> real estate a N N surge from the $ N million of <unk> property homefed held a year ago 
 homefed has $ N billion of assets 
 homefed said most of the troubled assets are apartment <unk> shopping <unk> and other commercial real estate 
 it said about half are in california with the rest scattered across the country 
 it said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year 
 homefed said the slide in loan <unk> was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the california market 
 any such downturn in california would be grim news for west coast thrifts particularly the less healthy ones which have performed poorly even with a <unk> market 
 but homefed said it <unk> <unk> loan <unk> in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over <unk> the government 's massive thrift bailout bill 
 it said its real-estate operations earned a record $ N million more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ N million 
 and analysts said they see no signs of an imminent <unk> in california real estate even with last week 's earthquake 
 the thrift said earnings also were <unk> in the quarter by a $ N million provision for losses associated with its previously reported plan to liquidate a real-estate franchise network 
 for the nine months homefed earned $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share a N N increase from year-earlier net income of $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share 
 yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week 
 the average yield on six-month cds of $ N and less slipped to N N from N N according to banxquote money markets an information service based here 
 on one-year cds of $ N and less the average slid to N N from N N 
 both issues are among the most popular with individual investors 
 because of <unk> in the economy rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon said <unk> mehl chairman of banxquote 
 it 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon 
 changes in cd yields in the week ended tuesday were in line with <unk> up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months 
 interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year 
 the average yield on <unk> three-month cds moved up <unk> of a percentage point in the latest week to N N 
 long-term cds declined just a fraction 
 the average yield on both two-year cds and five-year cds was N N

 the average yield on six-month <unk> cds rose to N N from N N and on one-year cds the average yield rose to N N from N N 
 the brokerage firms which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose cds they sell generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on <unk> or from banks and thrifts directly 
 <unk> sold at monday 's auction yielded N N for six months and N N for three months up from N N and N N respectively the week before 
 so-called jumbo cds typically in denominations of $ N and up also usually follow <unk> and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors 
 some <unk> posted <unk> changes in average yields this week both up and down 
 the average yield on <unk> <unk> rose to N N from N N while the two-year average fell by the same amount to N N 
 six-month and <unk> yields were unchanged on average 
 the cd market is unsettled right now said banxquote 's mr. mehl 
 it 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market 
 the small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks 
 some however lowered yields significantly 
 at chase manhattan bank in new york for example the yield on a small <unk> six-month cd fell about a quarter of a percentage point to N N 
 in california bank of america dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year savings cds to N N from N N 
 yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average N N for $ N and less and down just a <unk> of a percentage point to N N for jumbo deposits

 benjamin jacobson & sons has been the new york stock exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in ual corp. and its <unk> since the early 1930s 
 but the firm has never had a day like yesterday 
 at first ual did n't open because of an order <unk> 
 when it did a half-hour into the session it was priced at $ N a share down more than $ N from monday 's close 
 it sank further to as low as $ N but a big rally developed in the last half hour pushing the stock back up to close at $ N down just $ N from monday 
 in the process N million shares traded making ual the second most active issue on the big board 
 <unk> pizza when they could and <unk> until their voices gave out the two benjamin jacobson specialists at the big board 's ual trading post yesterday <unk> over what can only be described as a financial <unk> 
 it was chaotic 
 but we like to call it controlled chaos said <unk> robert j. jacobson jr. <unk> of the firm 's founder 
 he <unk> the ual post yesterday with christopher bates N an energetic long <unk> who 's a dead ringer for actor <unk> <unk> 
 who was doing all the selling 
 options traders arbitrage traders everyone said mr. bates cooling down with a <unk> of apple <unk> after the close yesterday 
 added mr. jacobson there were some pretty bad losses in the stock 
 big board traders said a <unk> buy order at $ N a share entered by bear stearns & co. which was active in ual stock all day is what set off the ual crowd in the late afternoon 
 a subsequent rally in ual helped the staggering stock market stage an <unk> recovery from an <unk> deficit to finish only slightly below monday 's close 
 both jacobson traders who had been hoping ual trading would get back to normal read the news about the <unk> of ual takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning 
 the news told them it would be a while longer before ual resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations 
 when mr. jacobson walked into the office at N a.m. edt he announced ok buckle up 
 messrs. jacobson and bates walked on the big board floor at about N a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble 
 already entered in the big board 's computers and <unk> to their post were sell orders for N ual shares 
 the ual news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor 
 ual which closed on the big board monday at $ N a share traded in the third market afterward as low as $ N a share 
 there were rumors of $ <unk> trades 
 in the N minutes before the N opening bell the jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders heavier than they <unk> 
 and at N they posted a $ N to $ N first indication or the price range in which the stock would probably open 
 that range was quickly narrowed to $ N to $ N although traders surrounding the post were told that $ N to $ N would be the likely target 
 when ual finally opened a half hour late some N shares traded at $ N 
 there was selling pressure from everyone said one trader 
 this month 's friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by ual news was n't as bad for the jacobson specialists as yesterday 's action 
 on that earlier day the stock 's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath 
 not yesterday 
 mr. jacobson his gray hair flying did n't wear out his <unk> <unk> but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new <unk> 
 mr. bates usually handles day-to-day ual trading on his own 
 but yesterday the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only messrs. jacobson and bates but four other jacobson partners all doing their <unk> job of <unk> buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market 
 about N floor traders <unk> near the ual post most of the day and probably hundreds more came and went a <unk> mass as one trader described it 
 the N <unk> volume flowing through the jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock 
 the heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps 
 the bear stearns order that marked the <unk> turnaround caused a massive buying effort as ual jumped $ N a share to $ N in the last half hour said mr. bates 
 with N seconds of trading to go mr. jacobson with what voice he had left announced to the trading <unk> we 're going to trade one price on the bell 
 that meant no trading would occur in the final seconds as a way of making sure that <unk> orders are n't <unk> to a sudden price swing that would upset customers 
 about N shares sold at $ N on the bell representing about eight to N late orders the specialists estimate 
 big board traders praised the jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt 
 in chicago a ual spokesman by way of policy declined to comment on the company 's stock or the specialists ' performance 
 leaving the exchange at about N p.m. the jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today 
 said <unk> ellis a jacobson partner who got involved in the ual action it all starts all over again today 
 britain 's current account deficit dropped to # N billion $ N billion in september from an adjusted # billion $ N billion the previous month but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the u.k. economy next year 
 the confederation of british industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a <unk> slowdown largely because of a <unk> series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to N N 
 the outlook has deteriorated since the summer with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill said david <unk> chairman of the industry group 's economic committee 
 he also said investment by businesses is falling off 
 of N companies surveyed N N expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery while only N N plan to spend more 
 but despite mounting recession fears government data do n't yet show the economy <unk> to a halt 
 unemployment for example has continued to decline and the september trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports 
 as a result prime minister margaret thatcher 's government is n't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring if then 
 chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation which was <unk> by tax cuts and loose credit policies in N and N 
 officials fear that any <unk> this year could <unk> inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies 
 <unk> off attacks on his economic policies in a house of commons debate yesterday mr. lawson said inflation remains the greatest threat to our economic <unk> and promised to take whatever steps are needed to <unk> it off 
 the latest government figures said retail prices in september were up N N from a year earlier 
 many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year 
 david owen u.k. economist with kleinwort benson group reduced his growth forecast for N to N N from N N and termed the risk of recession next year quite high 
 but he said the downturn probably wo n't become a major <unk> similar to those of N and N 
 still britain 's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the european community 's plan to create a unified market by N 
 compared with the major economies on the continent the u.k. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months 
 as a result mr. owen warned investment will be more likely to flow toward the other european economies and the u.k. will be less prepared for the single market 
 britain 's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy such as a surge in the volume of exports which were N N higher than a year earlier 
 but while september exports rose to # N billion imports shot up to # N billion 
 the resulting # N billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of # N million in so-called <unk> items which include income from investments services and official transfers 
 despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap economists expect the current account deficit for all of N to swell to about # N billion from # N billion in N 
 increasingly economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of british industry 
 when the country gets <unk> we tend to buy high-quality imports mr. owen said 
 vickers plc a british aerospace defense and automotive conglomerate said it reached an agreed cash bid of # N million $ N million for ross <unk> group plc a maker of specialty <unk> and <unk>

 vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a <unk> loan note in <unk> of cash 
 the notes can be redeemed starting in july N 
 the company said its acquisition of ross <unk> will be covered largely by cash raised in its july disposal of <unk> for # N million

 a group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of <unk> hoping to rebuild it 
 other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred <unk> or <unk> breeding rights 
 one big problem has been the thoroughbred <unk> market 
 from N to N prices for the best <unk> at the summer sales rose N N to an average of $ N

 you can see the highs and lows of the business all under one <unk> she tells the group 
 there are n't too many winners 
 perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business 
 some badly managed partnerships have burned investors sometimes after they received advice from industry consultants 
 so owners have developed a code of ethics <unk> rules for consultants and agents and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest 
 but some are skeptical of the code 's effectiveness 
 the industry is based on individual honesty says cap <unk> a lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought <unk> 
 despite the drop in prices for <unk> owning one still is n't cheap 
 at the low end investors can spend $ N or more to own a <unk> in partnership with others 
 at a <unk> sale a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars 
 but that means paying the horse 's maintenance on average it costs $ N a year to raise a horse

 general electric co. executives and lawyers provided misleading and false information to the pentagon in N in an effort to cover up longstanding fraudulent billing practices federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs 
 the government 's startling allegations filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal <unk> trial against ge in philadelphia federal district court challenge the <unk> and <unk> of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor 
 in a strongly <unk> response <unk> a filing made in the same court yesterday ge asserted that prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses distorted documents and ignored important facts 
 the company attacked the government 's allegations as reckless and <unk> <unk> and said its management promptly and accurately reported to the pentagon all relevant information about billing practices 
 the case strikes at the corporate image of ge which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic <unk> equipment to highly classified design work on the strategic defense initiative and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if pentagon and justice department officials take a tough stance 
 the company has been considered an industry leader in <unk> cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices 
 but the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to <unk> from federal authorities the extent and details of widespread fraudulent billing practices 
 the problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's space systems division which has been the focus of two separate <unk> prosecutions by the government since N 
 the dispute stems from pretrial <unk> in the pending court case in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company <unk> reports and documents 
 last november a federal grand jury indicted ge on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to <unk> the army of $ N million on a <unk> computer contract 
 the company for its part maintains that many of the disputed documents are <unk> <unk> communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors 
 a hearing is scheduled on the issue today 
 the government 's <unk> filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in march N when ge was accused of <unk> the pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on <unk> missile contracts 
 ge pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ N million in the <unk> case which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the philadelphia court 
 in order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts prosecutors contend that <unk> ge executives and company lawyers provided misleading statements to <unk> force secretary <unk> <unk> and other pentagon officials during a series of meetings in N 
 overall the government contends that ge 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to curry favor with pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management <unk> and allegedly pervasive billing <unk> uncovered by company investigations 
 prosecutors <unk> a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of <unk> from N to N despite warnings from an internal <unk> 
 when ge finally disclosed the problems prosecutors contend that mr. <unk> was <unk> informed that the suspected practices had only just been discovered by ge management 
 in its brief the government asserted that it needs the internal ge documents to <unk> anticipated efforts by ge during the trial to demonstrate its good corporate character 
 ge which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than N boxes and file <unk> of documents <unk> that senior ge managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until N and that the information was passed on quickly to mr. <unk> at his first meeting with company representatives 
 subsequent meetings initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts were held to <unk> mr. <unk> with the company 's <unk> procedures and to disclose additional information according to ge 
 ge 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity 
 the company 's conduct does not even raise a question of <unk> corporate intent <unk> or <unk> ge 's brief asserts 
 on the contrary it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely <unk> waters

 savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites the office of thrift supervision said 
 but that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are <unk> against blacks the agency said 
 the office an arm of the treasury said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often 
 nevertheless on capitol hill where the information was released yesterday at a senate banking subcommittee hearing lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely <unk> against minorities 
 they asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with <unk> laws 
 sen. alan <unk> d ill. chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs said i 'm not a <unk> 
 but when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites and in some cities it is three and four times as often i conclude that discrimination is part of the problem 
 james <unk> a spokesman for the u.s. league of savings institutions said the data is a red flag but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread 
 the trade group official added certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it 
 sen. <unk> held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of <unk> in mortgage lending 
 the legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race sex and income level of borrowers but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least 
 the federal reserve said its studies in recent years which adjust for income differences and other <unk> showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites 
 but john <unk> a fed governor told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the fed 's believes the vast majority of banks are n't <unk> 
 for instance he noted the fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites 
 several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination 
 we would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years to developing <unk> for discrimination said jonathan <unk> a top official of the office of thrift supervision 
 if we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly said sen. donald <unk> d. mich. chairman of the banking committee then that is a matter that needs remedy now not six months from now or six years from now or N years from now 
 officials of the federal deposit insurance corp. and the office of the comptroller of the currency said they have <unk> only a few banks for violations of <unk> laws

 the agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited 
 thrift regulators did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions 
 mr. <unk> said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of <unk> government investigators who would pose as home buyers

 time warner inc. is considering a legal challenge to tele-communications inc. 's plan to buy half of showtime networks inc. a move that could lead to <unk> war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players 
 time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining tele-communications as investors in showtime cable-tv industry executives say 
 time officials declined to comment 
 last week tele-communications agreed to pay viacom inc. $ N million for a N N stake in its showtime subsidiary which is a distant second to time 's home box office in the delivery of <unk> networks to cable subscribers 
 tele-communications the u.s. 's largest cable company said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment 
 tele-communications is hbo 's largest customer and the two have a number of other business relationships 
 earlier this year time even discussed bringing tele-communications in as an investor in hbo executives at both companies said 
 the purchase of the showtime stake is a direct <unk> in our face said one senior time executive 
 time is expected to mount a legal challenge in u.s. district court in new york where viacom in may filed a $ N billion antitrust suit charging time and hbo with <unk> the <unk> business and trying to crush competition from showtime 
 executives involved in <unk> time 's defense say it is now preparing a <unk> naming both viacom and tele-communications as defendants 
 the executives say time may seek to break up the transaction after it is <unk> or may seek constraints that would prevent tele-communications from dropping hbo in any of its cable systems in favor of showtime 
 viacom officials declined to comment 
 jerome <unk> tele-communications ' chief outside counsel said he was n't aware of time 's legal plans 
 but he said that any effort by time to <unk> the tele-communications investment in showtime as <unk> would be the pot calling the <unk> black 
 it 's hard to see how an investment by the largest cable operator in the weaker of the two networks is <unk> when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest cable operator mr. <unk> said 
 in addition to owning hbo with N million subscribers time warner separately operates cable-tv system serving about N million cable-tv subscribers 
 tele-communications controls close to N million cable subscribers and viacom has about one million 
 in its suit against time viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and <unk> networks gives the company too much market power 
 time argues that in joining up with tele-communications viacom has potentially more power particularly since viacom also owns cable networks <unk> <unk> and <unk> at <unk> 
 ironically tele-communications and time have often worked closely in the cable business 
 together they control nearly N N of turner broadcasting systems inc. tele-communications has a N N stake while time warner has a N N stake 
 but since time 's merger with warner communications inc. relations between the two have become <unk> 
 each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too <unk> integrated 
 meanwhile some legal observers say the tele-communications investment and other developments are weakening viacom 's antitrust suit against time 
 viacom <unk> time in its suit of refusing to carry showtime or a sister service the movie channel on time 's manhattan cable tv system one of the nation 's largest urban systems 
 but yesterday manhattan cable announced it will launch showtime on nov. N to over N subscribers 
 showtime has also accused hbo of <unk> up the lion 's share of hollywood 's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios 
 but showtime has continued to sign new contracts with hollywood studios and yesterday announced it will buy movies from columbia pictures entertainment inc. which currently has a <unk> arrangement with hbo 
 the federal trade commission said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring imo industries inc. from acquiring the shares outstanding of the u.s. unit of the british company united scientific holdings plc for $ N million

 the ftc said it would seek to <unk> the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court but declined to specify which one 
 under federal law if the court grants a preliminary injunction the ftc must begin administrative proceedings to determine the <unk> of the proposed stock purchase within N days

 the airline industry 's fortunes in <unk> shape for most of the year have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks 
 citing rising fuel costs promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results 
 yesterday usair group inc. recently one of the industry 's <unk> performers posted a <unk> $ N million net loss for the period 
 so far the industry 's fourth quarter is n't looking too strong either prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as <unk> 
 and they say the outlook for N is nearly as bad 
 airlines in N came in like a bang and are going out like a <unk> said kevin murphy an airline analyst at morgan stanley & co 
 this turn of events has put a big <unk> on an industry that seemed almost <unk> last spring when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on <unk> in certain markets 
 now many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on wall street 
 the downturn also raises questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new airplanes which currently total $ N billion over the next three years 
 for travelers though the industry 's problems have had some positive effects 
 in recent weeks airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers 
 others have tried to <unk> up <unk> programs 
 previously airlines were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive 
 just last week for example trans world airlines and pan am corp. 's pan american world airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $ N to $ N to certain <unk> members making <unk> flights in business class or first class 
 the industry 's slowdown became apparent this month when amr corp. parent of american airlines reported an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be disappointing 
 shortly before that usair had said its third-quarter results would be significantly lower than a year earlier 
 yesterday it provided the details 
 its loss of $ N million or $ N a share <unk> with net of $ N million or $ N a share in the N third quarter 
 revenue rose only N N in the latest period to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 for the nine months the <unk> va. company 's net plunged N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the results surprised many analysts because usair has almost no competition in its pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of <unk> airlines 
 shortly after announcing its quarterly loss usair 's stock tumbled $ N a share 
 it ended at $ N down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 nobody was expecting this size of a loss said paul <unk> an analyst with first boston corp 
 one airline executive who declined to be identified called the loss amazing 
 in announcing the results usair cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently 
 it said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer 
 to try to combat the traffic slowdown airlines started reducing fares average fares rose only N N in august in contrast to increases of N N each in february and march 
 but so far the effort has failed and traffic is still slow 
 some other fare promotions have <unk> 
 this summer the industry introduced a kids fly free program in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult 
 airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected 
 airlines also say their <unk> programs are <unk> profits because <unk> are being redeemed at a <unk> rate 
 one airline official said about three times as many <unk> coupons are being turned in as in previous years not surprisingly as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up <unk> at triple the normal rate 
 rising operating expenses are another problem 
 fuel costs were up N N in the third quarter 
 labor costs which <unk> off in the past few years because of lower pay <unk> for newer employees are on the <unk> again at many carriers 
 and some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches usair for example blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by hurricane hugo last month 
 we can not <unk> the total adverse effects of hugo said edwin <unk> chairman and president of usair group 
 whatever the cause for the downturn few people are predicting any sudden improvement 
 airline economics inc. an aviation consulting firm is projecting an industrywide operating profit of $ N billion for N compared with earlier forecasts of $ N billion to $ N billion 
 as for N the firm predicts that profit will slip to between $ N billion and $ N billion

 the <unk> schedule of <unk> will be kicked off officially with a combination live and <unk> <unk> special at the <unk> bowl in january 
 all the <unk> though have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far 
 there are too many people participating says al <unk> of <unk> & <unk> a greenwich conn. marketing consulting firm 
 if you want to cut through the clutter you have to make your message as distinct sharp and individual as possible 
 sharing a character with other advertisers is n't a way to do that 
 but united media says it 's very <unk> with the contracts it hands out 
 we 're not interested in promoting every single product that comes along mr. shore says 
 metropolitan life ad executives could n't be reached about the use of the peanuts characters by others 
 but mr. shore says that company 's exclusive advertising rights extend only to the insurance and financial services category

 the association said domestic demand grew N N in september 
 demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of <unk> government policies an association spokesman said

 stock of united airlines parent ual corp. <unk> wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the ual board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction 
 the board 's decision announced after the market closed monday initially prompted a severe sell-off in ual shares which at midday traded as low as $ N a share down $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the <unk> <unk> for takeover-stock traders who by then had seen ual stock tumble N N since oct. N also triggered a <unk> sell-off that sent the dow jones industrial average down more than N points at N a.m 
 but then steady concentrated buying by bear stearns & co. which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders took hold and <unk> the fall in ual which eventually buoyed the entire market 
 the industrial average closed down only N points at N 
 late in the afternoon several big purchases by bear stearns particularly a block of N shares at N p.m. at $ N a share triggered a buying spree that took ual up more than N points in the final hour of trading 
 ual stock closed at $ N a share down $ N 
 volume was a tumultuous N million shares or N N of the N million ual shares outstanding 
 traders estimated that bear stearns bought more than N million shares 
 the two most frequently rumored buyers neither of whom would comment were coniston partners which battled the ual board in N and new york real estate developer donald trump who recently made and withdrew an offer for american airlines parent amr corp 
 however one person familiar with ual said the signs pointed to coniston because mr. trump has n't asked for permission to buy more than $ N million of stock under federal antitrust rules 
 takeover-stock traders <unk> by their huge losses in ual stock remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse oct. N of a $ 300-a-share $ N billion labor-management buy-out 
 their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder <unk> 
 baker nye investments a new york takeover-stock trader that owns ual stock would n't comment on reports the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote 
 but partner richard nye said this is the most extraordinary failed transaction i 've seen in N years in this business 
 it would make sense for somebody to do it 
 i have never seen a case of <unk> shared by so many participants 
 in N baker nye <unk> a proxy fight for control of leaseway transportation inc. that ultimately led to leaseway 's being sold 
 some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by ual 's investment adviser first boston corp. that <unk> could yield $ N to $ N a share 
 but those would require pilots ' cooperation 
 any investor who acquires ual stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with united 's contentious unions 
 the pilots are working under an expired contract and the machinists contract expires next month 
 that gives them enormous leverage including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose 
 however a catalyst like coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting monday 
 the pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ N and $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion 
 one person familiar with ual said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid rushing around selling the company at a bargain price particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month 
 even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't <unk> with the board 's logic 
 but the board 's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday 
 we had a lot of people who threw in the towel today said <unk> ellis a partner in benjamin jacobson & sons a specialist in trading ual stock on the big board 
 another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their ual stock at the bottom but already own so much they ca n't buy any more 
 this deal is like a <unk> motel he said 
 they check in but they ca n't check out 
 but both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction 
 so too according to many reports is british airways plc despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out 
 the pilots might end up <unk> up with their longtime <unk> the machinists union in a recapitalization 
 the machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for <unk> that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake 
 the company rejected those past proposals 
 it is unclear however if the machinists would support a majority stake as the pilots want 
 a <unk> official said that would depend on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake 
 some investors whose names were <unk> about by traders as potential ual stock buyers said they were n't buying 
 i 'm not interested said dallas investor harold simmons 
 a source close to carl icahn a corporate raider who owns trans world airlines inc. said he has n't owned any ual stock and is n't buying 
 one person familiar with texas billionaire robert bass said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves 
 and a spokesman for reliance group holdings inc. which had held N N of ual before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below N N would n't comment 
 marvin davis whose $ N billion takeover bid originally put the nation 's second-largest airline in play is limited by a standstill agreement with ual he signed in september 
 the los angeles investor ca n't buy ual stock <unk> shareholder <unk> or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ N a share or ual <unk> an offer below $ N 
 however mr. davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be <unk> or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price 
 times mirror co. said third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share compared with net income of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the los angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $ N million gain from the sale of assets primarily <unk> 
 revenue was $ N million up N N from $ N million 
 stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and <unk> publishing divisions plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper the los angeles times offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the eastern u.s. the company said 
 looking ahead to the fourth quarter the outlook for the newspaper group remains <unk> with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our eastern markets said robert f. <unk> times mirror 's chairman and chief executive 
 copper futures sold off sharply yesterday influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar and a rally in bonds 
 december copper opened near monday 's close tried to rally but failed and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ N a pound off N cents for the day 
 stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a <unk> price 
 william kaiser president of the kaiser financial group in chicago said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market which partly reflected a weakening economy 
 he said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing 
 mr. kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets which became <unk> weaker two to three weeks ago 
 but though a weakening economy implies reduced demand mr. kaiser said that third world <unk> countries have n't any choice but to sell copper 
 they might even step up sales in a falling market he said in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their <unk> 
 technically mr. kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ N to $ N range thinking there was support at the $ N level 
 when the market fell below that level on monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level traders started selling out their positions 
 <unk> <unk> senior metals analyst at prudential-bache securities in new york agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature 
 she said the market hit the $ N level at around N a.m. edt where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders 
 more stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $ N where modest buying was attracted 
 ms. <unk> said the settling of strikes in canada and mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year 
 she thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ N to $ N range 
 i believe that as soon as the selling <unk> somewhat we could see a rally back to the $ N region she added 
 she thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well 
 she noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about N N to N N 
 if the number is a little better then copper will respond <unk> if it is worse then more selling could <unk> she predicted 
 ms. <unk> noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky 
 yesterday for example the durable goods numbers came out for september and the number was down only N N she said 
 however if you exclude <unk> orders then durable goods were down N N 
 i believe that number reflects a slowing economy 
 she said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next tuesday 
 however david <unk> president of <unk> & co. an international metals company noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of N and that projected production is below last year 
 mr. <unk> said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months with declining use being the result 
 but he added we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years 
 he noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about N weeks 
 he said the normal ratio is five to six weeks 
 according to mr. <unk> the <unk> in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries 
 it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into <unk> he said 
 if there is n't a recession he said we will be out of copper by the end of march 
 if there is a recession that will change the statistical situation 
 he thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ N a pound which was reached last year 
 in the past mr. <unk> has been known to have substantial long positions that is he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices in the copper futures market 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 energy the attitude was <unk> in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
 prices for the u.s. benchmark west texas intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ N a barrel for december delivery 
 several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking 
 but an early <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average stopped the crude rally cold 
 the industrial average recovered to close only N points lower but petroleum futures never shook off the <unk> 
 most market participants said they were looking to this week 's inventory statistics from the american petroleum institute to give the market some direction 
 the report is n't generally available until late on <unk> 
 precious metals futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading 
 december gold was up $ N an ounce at $ N december silver gained N cents to $ N an ounce 
 january platinum rose $ N an ounce to $ N 
 mr. kaiser said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets 
 he noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases but the sales do n't seem to have materialized 
 ms. <unk> thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar 
 gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty <unk> in the financial markets as it did yesterday she said 
 mr. kaiser noted that gold was more than N times the price of silver at the close yesterday which is historically high 
 the high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a <unk> metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy he said 
 grains and soybeans prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather 
 the sale to the chinese government of N metric tons of wheat under the government 's export <unk> program was announced after the close of trading monday but the sale was expected and failed to <unk> prices yesterday said dale <unk> a futures analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. in chicago 
 as for other export customers the soviet union is n't expected to be back buying u.s. corn in significant amounts until early next year he said 
 a number of commercial grain users <unk> that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in march indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year 's first quarter 
 cocoa futures at first continued the rally begun on monday but then faltered and closed lower 
 the december contract opened just under monday 's close triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ N a metric ton pushing the price to $ N and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests 
 the contract settled at $ N a ton off $ N 
 robert <unk> senior commodities analyst at kaiser financial group said monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about N minutes after the opening 
 he said even though there was arbitrage buying in new york because of the weak dollar cocoa fell to <unk> pressure from bearish traders 
 but he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa 
 the december contract reached its <unk> low of $ N a ton on oct. N its lifetime high was $ N set in N and its recent high was $ N set in early august 
 the last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in N 
 but while further modest declines might be ahead mr. <unk> said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high 
 citizens first bancorp inc. said it agreed to buy <unk> first financial group inc. a <unk> n.j. bank holding company for about $ N million in cash and stock 
 citizens first which controls citizens first national bank and is based in <unk> rock n.j. will pay a maximum of N N in cash for the parent of <unk> savings bank and the remainder in convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of $ N a share 
 <unk> holders will have the option to request either stock or cash 
 the convertible preferred will pay dividends at N N and be convertible into shares of citizens first at a rate equal to N N above the average closing price of the stock during a <unk> period prior to the transaction 's completion 
 the deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval 
 color systems technology inc. los angeles said its major creditor general electric pension trust agreed to convert $ N million of debt owed into N N of color system 's fully diluted common stock 
 the agreement also calls for general electric pension a unit of general electric co. to receive as much as N N of color systems ' fully diluted common stock depending on the proceeds from the sale of the <unk> film library and its receivables 
 general electric pension took control of the <unk> library last month after color systems defaulted on the loan 
 the agreement depends on color systems ' ability to win similar concessions from other creditors 
 buddy young president said the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within N days 
 color systems which <unk> black-and-white film to color <unk> posted a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million for the fiscal year ended june N 
 its stock fell N cents to $ N in american stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 next to kohlberg kravis roberts 's <unk> rjr nabisco deal sci television is small <unk> 
 but the troubles of sci tv are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of the 1980s especially the <unk> game 
 sci tv which expects to release a plan to restructure $ N billion of debt in the next day or so is n't just another lbo that went bad after <unk> on debt though it did do that 
 the cable and tv station company was an lbo of an lbo a set of assets that were leveraged twice enabling the blue-chip buy-out king henry kravis in N to take more than $ N billion of cash out of the <unk> <unk> 
 sci tv 's buy-out was an <unk> in the hole for mr. kravis and for investors in kkr partnerships 
 but it has left holders of sci tv 's junk bonds holding the bag including some <unk> that kkr might need to finance future deals such as kemper financial services first executive columbia savings & loan and prudential insurance co. of america 
 some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against kkr or moves to force sci tv into bankruptcy court 
 and kkr 's majority partner in sci tv 's buy-out <unk> tenn. entrepreneur george gillett also is said to be very unhappy 
 sci tv 's six stations once were part of storer communications 
 kkr loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an N buy-out then later sold storer 's cable operations at a fat profit 
 in N kkr for the second time <unk> debt onto storer 's tv stations selling them for $ N billion to a new entity that was <unk> by kkr and <unk> by gillett corp. which now operates the sci tv stations 
 in this second lbo kkr with one hand took more than $ N billion of cash out of the tv company 's assets and moved it into the storer cable operations making them more valuable in a N sale 
 storer also took $ N million of junior sci tv bonds as partial payment for the tv assets 
 with the other hand kkr put back into sci tv less than N N of the cash it had taken out buying sci tv common and preferred shares 
 so while kkr today has an estimated $ N million <unk> in <unk> sci tv including equity and debt the lbo firm still is $ N billion ahead on the sci tv buy-out after taking cash up front 
 on storer as a whole kkr racked up compound annual returns of N N in the three years it owned storer 
 meanwhile mr. gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $ N million in sci tv if the company ca n't be restructured 
 overall mr. gillett 's holding company gillett holdings is heavily <unk> and except for its <unk> mountain resorts is n't doing very well 
 with the tv business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if sci tv had to be liquidated today it might fetch N N less than in the N buy-out <unk> out most of the company 's junk-holders and its stockholders 
 meanwhile sci tv can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon <unk> a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due 
 sci tv 's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire nov. N 
 it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt 
 negotiations have started con <unk> but that 's not to say we like this particular offer says wilbur ross of rothschild inc. adviser to sci tv junk-holders 
 no major player in the sci tv deal will talk publicly 
 but it 's understood that mr. kravis is disappointed that mr. gillett did n't manage to boost sci tv 's operating profit after the buy-out 
 mr. kravis apparently thinks sci tv can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until tv stations rise in value again allowing sci tv to sell assets to pay debt 
 mr. gillett is said to be proud of his operating record he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a detroit station 
 as for junk-holders they 're <unk> it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by kkr 
 the bonds of sci tv now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about N cents on the dollar according to <unk> smith & co. in new york which trades <unk> securities 
 people who have seen sci tv 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by kkr and gillett corp 
 they would both give part of their combined $ N million in common equity in sci tv to holders of sci tv 's $ N million of junk bonds as a <unk> to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company 
 but some <unk> sci tv junk-holders say that 's not enough 
 they contend that sci tv 's equity now is <unk> 
 they add that it is n't costing kkr anything to give up equity because of its big <unk> cash profit on the buy-out which they think contributed to sci tv 's current problems 
 kemper the biggest holder of senior sci tv bonds has refused to join the <unk> committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options 
 to protect their claims some junk-holders want kkr and perhaps mr. gillett to invest new money in sci tv perhaps $ N million or more 
 one investment banker who is n't involved in the deal says sci tv needs at least $ N million of new equity to survive 
 junk-holders say they have a stick to beat kkr with the threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool to extract money from kkr says one big sci tv holder 
 this could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for kkr he adds 
 a big bankruptcy-court case might <unk> kkr 's name and provide new fuel for critics of lbos in washington and elsewhere 
 but others say junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting sci tv into bankruptcy-law proceedings 
 while kkr does n't control sci tv which is unusual for a kkr investment it clearly has much deeper pockets than mr. gillett 
 bankruptcy specialists say mr. kravis set a precedent for putting new money in sour lbos recently when kkr restructured <unk> <unk> furniture doubling kkr 's equity stake 
 but with <unk> kkr was only trying to salvage its original investment says bankruptcy investor james rubin of <unk> <unk> rubin in new york 
 by contrast kkr probably has already made all the money it can on sci tv 
 and people who know mr. kravis say he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into sci tv 
 rubbermaid inc. reflecting strong earnings growth boosted its quarterly dividend N N to N cents a share from N cents 
 the maker of household products said the new dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N 
 separately the company 's board adopted a proposal to <unk> its N shareholder rights plan further <unk> the company from takeover 
 rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened 
 the board has stated repeatedly that rubbermaid should be independent said walter w. williams rubbermaid president 
 some changes to the plan were minor adjustments but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds N N or more of rubbermaid 's voting securities each right held by others would <unk> the holder to buy rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price 
 mr. williams said the exercise price is $ N meaning holders would have the right to buy $ N of rubbermaid stock for half price <unk> the investor 's N N stake 
 for the third quarter rubbermaid earned $ N million or N cents a share up N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 rubbermaid shares closed yesterday at $ N off N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 the stock market went on a dizzying ride as ual parent of united airlines once again led shares into a <unk> decline and then an afternoon comeback 
 at the end of it all the dow jones industrial average closed down N to N 
 at one point yesterday morning the dow was down N points 
 new york stock exchange volume was N shares 
 declining issues <unk> advancers N to N 
 yesterday 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that N days after the 190-point plunge on friday the 13th the stock market still has a bad case of nerves 
 takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges 
 and there is more volatility to come 
 october 13th left us with a cut and exposed <unk> said jack <unk> technical analyst for bear stearns 
 people are fearful and sensitive 
 everybody 's finger is one inch closer to the <unk> 
 i have never had as many calls as i had this morning 
 volatility is here to stay 
 the dow jones industrial average plunged about N points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell 
 for many it began to look like a <unk> of oct. N 
 as stocks and stock-index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the s&p N stock futures pit 
 under a <unk> crash reform the chicago mercantile exchange would n't permit the december s&p futures to fall further than N points for a half hour 
 that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the big board 
 but at a critical moment stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control 
 they <unk> up hundreds of s&p futures when the market needed it most 
 at about N a.m. edt several big buy orders hit the s&p pit simultaneously lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks 
 it is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected said one chicago-based futures trader 
 these guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are 
 traders said goldman sachs shearson lehman hutton and salomon brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the <unk> moment 
 shearson lehman hutton declined to comment 
 officials at goldman sachs and salomon brothers were unavailable for comment 
 as in the oct. N massacre yesterday morning 's drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in ual 
 a ual statement after the market closed monday indicated that the airline 's board wanted to keep the company independent effectively <unk> hopes of an immediate buy-out 
 five minutes before the big board opened a preliminary price was <unk> for ual somewhere between N and N a loss of as much as $ N a share from monday 's close 
 ual finally opened for trading at N a.m. at N down $ N 
 floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the big board specialist 's post where ual trades 
 there was a <unk> mass of people said one floor trader 
 then there was a big liquidation of stock across the board he added 
 takeover speculators who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ N million on ual started selling other stocks as well as s&p futures in an attempt to hedge against a further ual blood <unk> 
 shortly after the ual opening program traders started selling stocks in the major market index and s&p N index 
 the <unk> mmi <unk> the dow jones industrial average 
 by N a.m. the dow was down N 
 all <unk> in the mmi except exxon general motors and sears were down $ N to $ N 
 at N when the s&p N december futures contract <unk> to a <unk> loss under the force of sell programs s&p futures trading was halted and program trades on the big board were <unk> into a special computer that <unk> for order imbalances 
 under the rules adopted by the chicago mercantile exchange the futures contract can not drop below the limit but buyers can purchase futures 
 at this point the dow industrials were down N points and falling 
 the trading halt in the s&p N futures <unk> selling and confusion many traders maintain 
 but as the <unk> began to spread through the s&p pit the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively 
 it was <unk> said one futures trader 
 in five minutes the dow industrials climbed almost N points 
 the big futures buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the dow 's loss to N points by N a.m 
 traders said the futures buying was <unk> calculated by program traders 
 these firms sold stock into the big morning decline but seeing the <unk> of the market 's drop held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the s&p futures hit the trading limit 
 then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures which abruptly halted the stock market 's decline as traders began to buy stocks 
 from then on the dow industrials held at a loss of N to N points 
 then in <unk> trading <unk> buy orders for ual hit the market including a <unk> order through bear stearns that seemed to spark ual 's late price surge 
 almost simultaneously painewebber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks 
 the combined buying rallied the dow into a small gain before closing at a slight loss 
 some institutional traders loved the wild ride

 after being <unk> by a volatile stock market treasury bonds closed higher 
 but junk bonds took more hits 
 early in the day bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a <unk> rally 
 that happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy treasurys which are higher in quality and thus considered safe 
 some retail accounts such as commercial banks and pension funds wanted to get on the <unk> before it was too late said sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. minneapolis

 the industrial average ended at N down N points 
 economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing

 also the tw offering includes <unk> and <unk> securities which are currently unpopular

 the ratio which reflects the number of bids the treasury receives for each bid accepted is used to gauge investor demand 
 dealers said players <unk> away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery which in fact did happen 
 individual and japanese participation in the auction was disappointing according to dealers 
 interest by japanese investors was limited said michael <unk> chief economist at daiwa securities america inc 
 they are typically not active in two-year note auctions but today 's participation could be viewed as <unk> 
 however mr. <unk> added that the japanese generally have a positive view of the u.s. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline 
 he said possibly they 're waiting to buy at the quarterly refunding of government debt to be held next month by the treasury 
 a trader at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more than N N of the two-year notes

 short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower 
 the discount rate on three-month treasury bills was quoted at N N for a bond-equivalent yield of N N while the rate on six-month treasury bills was quoted at N N for a yield of N N 
 rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
 thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it

 the issue was very <unk> disney is such a well-known you can say world-wide name said <unk> <unk> head trader of european equities at kleinwort benson ltd. which is making a market in the issue 
 mr. <unk> estimated that the issue 's london debut was accompanied by very very heavy turnover between five million and six million shares 
 most of the buying was institutional he added 
 official trading in the shares will start in london paris and brussels on nov. N when the <unk> <unk> offering valued at the equivalent of nearly $ N billion comes to market in the european community 
 u.s. investors will be permitted to buy the shares from ec investors N days later

 ford motor co. <unk> its battle with general motors corp. over jaguar plc by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the british auto maker when restrictions on its <unk> are lifted 
 the statement was part of a ford filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission 
 ford did n't say how much it might offer for jaguar or when 
 the british government currently <unk> any outside investor from holding more than N N of the company 's shares without permission until dec. N 
 but with its stake in jaguar which it raised yesterday to N N ford could <unk> a special jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner 
 a successful vote would put pressure on the british government to lift the restriction 
 we have not made that decision to seek a jaguar special shareholders ' meeting said <unk> <unk> a ford spokesman in london 
 he emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of jaguar under the right circumstances and said those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment 
 last month ford announced plans to acquire as much as N N of jaguar 
 since then jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with gm and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month 
 analysts have been expecting a <unk> pact that would give the u.s. car maker an eventual N N stake in the british company and create joint ventures that would produce an <unk> range of cars 
 but the specter of ford eventually launching a <unk> bid could <unk> the <unk> talks 
 jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving gm a minority stake said one individual close to the talks adding it would n't surprise me if jaguar executives want to wait and see what the color of that ford bid is first 
 he predicted ford officials will meet with jaguar executives in the next week to <unk> their proposed offer 
 sir john <unk> jaguar 's chairman so far has refused to meet with ford officials but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal 
 as for gm its <unk> position has to be a full bid itself said stephen reitman european <unk> analyst at london brokers <unk> & drew 
 a ford takeover of jaguar would have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that general motors ca n't afford to step aside 
 they will have to throw their hat in the ring 
 a gm spokesman yesterday reiterated the company 's interest in acquiring a minority stake to help jaguar remain independent 
 a pitched battle could mean jaguar would fetch # N $ N a share or about # N billion $ N billion several analysts believe 
 the prospect of such a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks 
 u.s. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated N N of jaguar shares 
 in a declining london stock market yesterday jaguar shares were down four pence from monday in late trading at N pence $ N a share 
 in the u.s. jaguar 's american depositary receipts rose N cents in over-the-counter trading to $ N 
 both ford and gm badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the japanese in the european and u.s. markets 
 and financially strapped jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how 
 the company has expressed a preference for gm over ford because gm has promised it would keep jaguar independent 
 ford 's need to acquire some or all of jaguar became more <unk> last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its <unk> merkur scorpio sedan as a european luxury import in the u.s. 
 then last friday ford 's talks about a possible alliance with saab-scania ab of sweden collapsed 
 gm 's interest in jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the u.s. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market 
 its <unk> line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models but it lacks jaguar 's <unk> 
 gm officials also see a lot of potential in <unk> jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of group lotus plc a british engineering and specialty car maker gm bought in N

 shell oil

 a # N million $ N million british airways plc rights issue <unk> badly the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for united airlines ' parent ual corp 
 the united kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ N million purchase of a N N stake in ual 
 but british airways withdrew from the ual labor-management buy-out plan last friday after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ N billion buy-out 
 british airways said its shareholders accepted only N N of the convertible capital bonds but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters 
 analysts said that N N level marked the poorest showing for any major british rights issue since the N global stock market crash 
 it is close to being a record <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst with london broker smith new court securities 
 fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason 
 the obvious reason was for british air to buy a stake in united airlines 
 in a statement british air chairman lord king said the company was obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up but it would have been <unk> to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue 
 but except for the embarrassment british air will emerge relatively <unk> from the <unk> issue 
 underwriters led by lazard brothers & co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares 
 lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by <unk> the issue among u.k. institutional investors 
 the paper loss here is very small for these <unk> observed john nelson a lazard managing director 
 in any case he added most institutions probably wo n't sell the bonds 
 and instead of buying the ual stake the u.k. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war <unk> 
 from a cash flow point of view british airways is better off not being in united airlines in the short term said andy chambers an analyst at nomura research institute in london 
 added another u.k. analyst it gives them some cash in the back <unk> for when they want to do something 
 for instance british air is continuing to negotiate with <unk> royal dutch airlines about each acquiring a N N stake in <unk> world airlines the air transport subsidiary of the belgian national airline 
 a definitive agreement had been expected by the end of july 
 the failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on british air shares 
 the airline 's share price already is far below the N pence $ N level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late september 
 in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday the shares were off three pence at N pence 
 and because british air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market 
 but british air 's withdrawal from the ual buy-out could have further <unk> 
 some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split which may lead to the resignation of sir <unk> marshall the carrier 's chief executive officer 
 the stories are <unk> a british air spokesman said 
 there is no difference of opinion between chairman lord king and sir <unk> on any aspect of company policy

 in an oct. N editorial-page article it 's the world bank 's turn to adjust paul craig roberts <unk> most of the blame for what <unk> developing countries at the <unk> of the world bank 
 the article is unfortunately <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
 one of mr. roberts 's <unk> is that the bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries 
 this is just not so 
 the reality is that bank finances are rock solid 
 as of june N N the day our past fiscal year came to a close only N N of the bank 's portfolio was affected by <unk> of over six months 
 this is an <unk> low level 
 moreover the bank follows a prudent <unk> policy and has set aside $ N million against possible loan losses 
 for the same fiscal year by the way the bank 's net income was a robust $ N billion after provisions 
 because of the <unk> manner in which the bank goes about development financial markets have confidence in it 
 this helps explain the triple-a rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ N billion in fiscal N on the most <unk> terms 
 another of mr. roberts 's criticisms is that bank lending has done more harm than good by <unk> the wrong incentives and <unk> energy away from economic development 
 here too mr. roberts is way off the mark 
 the reality is that bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for N years 
 our traditional project loans have for instance supported <unk> energy pricing in the power sector sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient <unk> agencies 
 by and large these efforts have <unk> fruit 
 in my home region latin america much of the existing infrastructure base an important building block for development has been financed by the world bank 
 mr. roberts also takes a <unk> at the bank 's adjustment lending 
 what are the facts on this type of lending 
 the bank has been making adjustment loans for N years 
 as their name implies these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at <unk> their <unk> 
 typically these measures include reforms to <unk> the role of government and <unk> in the economy to open up <unk> economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector 
 support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the bank 's 
 over the years it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the third world through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the international finance corp 
 most recently the bank group has been expanded to include the <unk> investment guarantee agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against <unk> risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate 
 these are not the actions of a development agency <unk> to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government as mr. roberts alleges 
 rather they reflect the bank 's <unk> <unk> approach which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use

 the agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products maintaining production of the two most important ones corn and milk 
 mr. <unk> also said conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of <unk> farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods 
 the agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale 
 conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at <unk> prices 
 business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of <unk> waste 
 private-sector leaders praised the conasupo restructuring 
 but most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into conasupo government subsidy which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk 
 the food and drug administration banned all imports of mushrooms from china in response to a rash of <unk> <unk> linked to <unk> chinese mushrooms

 your sept. N politics & policy article about william bennett 's emergency drug plan for washington gives the impression that the fbi has not been nor is actively involved

 the fbi is very supportive of and an active participant in mr. bennett 's initiative 
 it was agreed at the outset of the washington drug initiative that the fbi 's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our national drug strategy 
 through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user but rather we target and attack major <unk> organizations that control a large segment of the drug market 
 the trial of <unk> <unk> iii in washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the drug enforcement administration and the metropolitan police department <unk> 
 the fbi 's role is to <unk> the d.c. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police <unk> handling drug-related crimes 
 in fact we have agents assigned full time to assist the <unk> in drug-related crimes such as <unk> and other crimes of violence

 the stock market 's decline coming after a record weekly gain of N points surprised some investors

 the poll conducted by the roper organization interviewed N adults age N and older from july N to july N N 
 responses were weighted on the basis of age and <unk> to conform with u.s. census data 
 for each poll the odds are N out of N that if <unk> had sought to survey every household in the u.s. using the same <unk> the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than N N percentage points in either direction 
 the margin of error for <unk> for example married women with children at home would be larger 
 in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question <unk> could introduce errors into the findings

 meredith corp. is launching a new service to offer advertisers package deals combining its book magazine and videocassette products 
 the des <unk> publisher said it created a new custom marketing group that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines such as <unk> home journal and better homes and gardens 
 in addition the group will create <unk> media such as <unk> newspaper <unk> and <unk> for ad campaigns 
 earlier this year meredith sold its first such package for $ N million to kraft inc. now a unit of new york-based philip morris <unk> 
 the kraft package included a specially published <unk> a national <unk> <unk> in sunday newspapers and a kraft <unk> section that ran in five meredith magazines 
 kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ N million on similar programs through N 
 bill murphy director of the new marketing unit said meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories but he would n't disclose their names 
 sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the meredith group 
 other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction 
 the new york times co. 's magazine group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its golf digest magazine 
 time warner inc. recently formed a <unk> department to seek out ways to offer advertisers packages that could combine time 's magazines with warner products such as <unk>

 mr. <unk> 's departure follows by two months the resignation of mark <unk> as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only N months at reebok 
 the resignations by the two executives considered <unk> and <unk> by reebok insiders reflect a difference in style with paul fireman chairman and chief executive according to several former executives 
 the two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ N billion 
 the changes come as reebok which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales <unk> of late is seeking to regain momentum in the <unk> business against rivals <unk> inc. and l.a. gear inc 
 the departures said alice ruth an analyst at montgomery securities in san francisco should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences

 i would view it as a net positive 
 the company can go about its business 
 they 're in the midst of a turnaround she noted

 the magazine is strong 
 it 's simply the right time to do what we are doing mr. <unk> said 
 magazines can no longer be considered institutions said james <unk> president of meredith corp. 's magazine group 
 publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die he added 
 magazines could like other brands find that they have only a limited life 
 there are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky <unk> are <unk> 
 more than ever independent magazines and small publishing groups are being <unk> up by larger publishing groups such as american express publishing corp. a unit of american express co. and <unk> <unk> publications inc. a unit of advance publications inc. which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers

 the affluent people and the corporations can buy it the poor <unk> in political cases get it free and everybody in between is at a disadvantage and that 's not the kind of system we want says <unk> <unk> a prominent sociologist who teaches at george washington university 
 sophisticated trial consulting grew ironically from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases 
 the <unk> N trial in N in which daniel <unk> and others were charged with <unk> <unk> violence was a landmark 
 in that case a group of <unk> <unk> interviewed N registered voters around <unk> 
 the researchers discovered that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were nearly always against the defendants the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury 
 the defense also learned that <unk> people were <unk> conservative about the vietnam war 
 a more blue-collar panel became a second aim 
 ultimately that carefully picked jury <unk> with a N vote to <unk> and the prosecution decided not to <unk> the case 
 litigation consulting had arrived 
 the fledgling science went corporate in N when international business machines corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case 
 the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas <unk> and david <unk> was how to make such a highly technical case <unk> 
 as the trial <unk> they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them 
 the solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury <unk> sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him 
 he then <unk> messrs. <unk> and <unk> who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation <unk> 
 thus the shadow jury was born 
 mr. vinson the professor got the law <unk> and formed litigation sciences 
 ibm won the case 
 the hardest thing in any complex case is to retain <unk> and in some sense your ignorance says mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> & moore 
 what you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it 
 a shadow jury is a way to do that in a more <unk> and organized way 
 the approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which energy transportation systems inc. sued santa fe pacific corp. over the transport of <unk> coal the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes <unk> over 
 energy transportation retained litigation sciences at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars to poll <unk> profile and shadow 
 just before the actual closing arguments the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors each of whom was being paid $ N a day 
 the jurors who did n't know which side had retained them decided for energy transportation and awarded $ N million in damages 
 the real jury returned days later with a $ N million victory for energy transportation 
 it 's just like weather forecasting says energy transportation trial attorney harry <unk> of vinson & <unk> 
 it 's often wrong but it 's better than consulting an indian rain <unk> 
 forecasting is only one part of litigation sciences ' work 
 changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters 
 and to the <unk> some of the firm 's approaches may seem <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case <unk> and <unk> 
 instead mr. vinson says interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to <unk> the facts of the case to fit their views 
 pre-trial <unk> helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of <unk> 
 if it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages for example depressed <unk> people are far more likely to grant them 
 someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a <unk> would be ideal litigation sciences advises 
 so would someone recently <unk> or <unk> 
 since litigation sciences generally represents the defense its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury 
 for personal-injury cases litigation sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people including victims get what they deserve 
 such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the <unk> handicapped the poor blacks and women 
 the consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work or toward particular movies or books 
 litigation sciences does n't make moral <unk> 
 if a client needs <unk> jurors the firm will help find them 
 as mr. vinson explains it we do n't control the facts 
 they are what they are 
 but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ 
 in our system of <unk> the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can 
 once a jury is selected the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation <unk> 
 logic plays a minimal role here 
 more important are what lsi calls psychological <unk> a few <unk> points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level 
 in one personal-injury case a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was <unk> <unk> 
 by repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm the defense lawyers planted doubt about the <unk> of the woman 's injuries 
 the <unk> worked 
 the defense won 
 in a classic defense of a personal-injury case the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame 
 the ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight mr. vinson has written 
 <unk> graphics <unk> for effectiveness also play a major role in litigation sciences ' operation 
 studies show the consultants say that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> help 
 the average american watches seven hours of tv a day 
 they are very <unk> sophisticated explains lsi graphics specialist robert <unk> 
 lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this 
 supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics 
 they may not have been able to <unk> it all but they did it says stephen <unk> a legal ethics expert at new york university law school 
 what you have here is <unk> made <unk> 
 many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one <unk> with the evidence 
 others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment and used that to advantage 
 litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome 
 litigation sciences concedes that in one in N cases it was <unk> wrong in its predictions 
 a few attorneys offer <unk> stories of jobs <unk> by consultants or of <unk> services as when one lawyer paid a consultant not at litigation sciences $ N to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more <unk> interviews with the same jurors in the american lawyer magazine 
 some <unk> <unk> at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury <unk> 
 the <unk> of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation says barry <unk> of simpson <unk> & bartlett who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against shell oil co 
 he says he used consultants in the case but found them to be virtually <unk> 
 but most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken 
 and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while <unk> such a <unk> massage 
 for more than a decade mr. <unk> the sociologist has been a leading critic of the <unk> 
 there 's no reason to believe that <unk> rule <unk> he says 
 but the last thing you want to do is manipulate the <unk> to make them think better 
 what you then do is you make them think <unk> 
 to <unk> the work of litigation scientists he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called <unk> challenges <unk> that do n't require <unk> 
 in most civil cases judges allow each side three such challenges 
 for complex cases judges sometimes allow many more 
 mr. <unk> also suggests <unk> anyone from gathering background information about the jurors 
 some courts release names and addresses and researchers can drive by houses look up credit ratings and even question neighbors 
 furthermore he says <unk> should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' <unk> 
 even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact 
 mr. <unk> the first lawyer to use mr. vinson 's services <unk> against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning known as <unk> dire or giving out personal information about the jurors 
 the more extensive the <unk> dire the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective and i do n't think courts should lend themselves to that mr. <unk> says 
 silicon graphics inc. a fast-growing maker of computer workstations said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $ N million over the next five years 
 one award is part of a department of defense contract to loral <unk> <unk> computers and could be valued at more than $ N million over five years 
 the other involves the sale of about N of the company 's high-end workstations to the national institutes of health 
 the models which cost about $ N each will be used in research 
 the <unk> are evidence that silicon graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers analysts said 
 the company 's on a roll said robert <unk> an analyst at hambrecht & quist 
 no other computer vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price 
 in the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors sun microsystems inc. hewlett-packard co. and digital equipment corp. which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs 
 silicon graphics on the other hand has targeted a specific niche since its inception in N which has been dubbed by some as <unk> computing 
 this is a style of <unk> computing that provides <unk> color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion 
 though silicon graphics is much smaller than digital <unk> and sun it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market 
 in addition the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices 
 a year ago silicon graphics introduced a model priced at $ N almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features 
 silicon graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future 
 it 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by N N to N N a year said edward <unk> the company 's chief executive officer 
 silicon graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off 
 revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N was $ N million a N N increase over the year-ago period 
 profit was $ N million compared with $ N million for the year-ago quarter 
 remember those <unk> <unk> refrigerators of N years ago 
 they or at least something less efficient than today 's <unk> units may soon be making a comeback 
 that something whatever it is could add as much as $ N to the $ N or so consumers now pay for <unk> refrigerators 
 these and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air <unk> to foam <unk> to commercial <unk> are in prospect because of something called the montreal protocol signed by N nations in N 
 in one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date involving products with an annual value of $ N billion in the u.s. alone the <unk> agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs 
 world-wide production would be cut in half by N 
 the u.s. senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of N to N 
 not to be <unk> george bush wants cfcs <unk> altogether by the year N a goal endorsed at an <unk> u.n. environmental meeting in <unk> in the spring 
 that 's a lot of <unk> as it turns out 
 cfcs are the primary <unk> in a gas often referred to by the du pont trade name <unk> which is <unk> to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in <unk> and <unk> equipment 
 <unk> containing cfcs are pumped into <unk> to make the foam used in <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> foam is a highly efficient <unk> which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and <unk> can be <unk> now than they were back in the days when they were <unk> with glass fiber 
 but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ N billion between now and the year N to convert to other <unk> <unk> agents and <unk> and to <unk> equipment for these less efficient <unk> the montreal protocol 's <unk> of supporters say it is worth it 
 they insist that cfcs are damaging the earth 's <unk> ozone layer which screens out some of the sun 's <unk> <unk> 
 hence as they see it if something is n't done <unk> will become ever more subject to <unk> and skin cancer 
 peter teagan a specialist in heat transfer is running a project at arthur d. little inc. of cambridge mass. to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate cfcs 
 in addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has <unk> studied the related topic of global warming a theory that <unk> 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a greenhouse effect that will work important <unk> changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time 
 i would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems says mr. teagan 
 in the kind of literature i read i come across <unk> opinions quite frequently 
 but the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon before all the evidence is in 
 we ca n't afford to wait 
 but does it have to be so soon 
 some atmospheric scientists think that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate the amount of ozone depletion would be only N N by the middle of the next century 
 it 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher <unk> in the u.s. 
 moreover there are questions particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer 
 it is generally agreed that when cfcs rise from earth to <unk> the <unk> in them is capable of <unk> with the process through which <unk> <unk> split <unk> <unk> and form ozone 
 but ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of <unk> cfcs in reducing it is largely a matter of <unk> 
 the ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure 
 what scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over <unk> that <unk> or contracts from year to year 
 but it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in <unk> 
 moreover surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems running for many years without either the <unk> gas or the <unk> ever <unk> 
 another argument of the environmentalists is that if <unk> are available why not use them 
 mr. teagan cites a list of <unk> but none so far match the <unk> <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> and propane can be used as <unk> for example but are <unk> 
 moreover new lubricants will be needed to protect <unk> from the new <unk> which as with cfcs are <unk> 
 mr. teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without cfcs is less efficient than current devices energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect 
 folks in the midwest who just suffered a mid-october <unk> may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it but let 's not be <unk> about grave risks 
 as it happens arthur d. little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories 
 it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cfcs 
 there is after all big money in environmentalism 
 maybe we should ask why it was that du pont so quickly <unk> and issued a statement giving it wide publicity that it was <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> introduced in N <unk> america by making <unk> and air <unk> practical after all 
 one answer is that big companies are growing <unk> of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them although they never care to put it quite that way 
 du pont as it happens has a potential substitute for cfcs 
 imperial chemical industries of the u.k. also has one and is building a plant in louisiana to produce it 
 japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own <unk> and hoping to <unk> new markets of course 
 there are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise 
 environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out <unk> describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it 
 university professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services <unk> when price <unk> destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for alternative energy 
 they needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts 
 in other words environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few 
 that tends to tilt the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the <unk> of the threats and the insistence of urgency 
 there is an element of <unk> involved 
 consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a <unk> or an <unk> car 
 if they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster the price would be cheap 
 but if there is no impending threat it can get to be very expensive 
 but worries about N 
 with most legislatures <unk> for the year small business is <unk> its <unk> 
 much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes from raising state minimum wage levels to <unk> benefits in health plans 
 while results were mixed in many states small business got by fairly well concludes don l. robinson associate director of the national federation of independent business the largest small-business organization 
 five states oregon <unk> island new hampshire iowa and wisconsin passed bills to boost the minimum wage but measures in N other states were defeated 
 oregon 's rate will rise to $ N an hour the nation 's highest in jan. N N 
 iowa 's will be the second highest at $ N an hour in january N but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate 
 in N central states one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of N bills <unk> health coverage or parental leave 
 the illinois legislature narrowly passed a <unk> bill which gov. james thompson vetoed and iowa and tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for <unk> <unk> 
 small business is bracing for an <unk> of similar proposals next year 
 those kinds of issues always keep coming back says robert <unk> who manages the illinois chamber of commerce 's small-business office 
 despite victories this year small business fears losing <unk> war 
 only two states vermont and washington this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with <unk> or adopted <unk> 
 similar proposals were defeated in at least N other states 
 but small business which generally <unk> <unk> benefits has taken note of the growing number of close votes 
 it 's just a matter of time before the tide turns says one midwestern lobbyist 
 consequently small business is taking more <unk> steps to counter mandated leaves 
 in pennsylvania small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt 
 they also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave 
 in N the issue is expected to be especially close in alaska california michigan new york pennsylvania and illinois 
 we 'll be playing a lot of defense especially in the midwest and northeast says jim <unk> of the <unk> 
 in los angeles more small businesses <unk> adopting a child-care policy 
 triggering the <unk> is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees 
 the <unk> treatment even applies to <unk> small contracts under $ N and consulting and temporary services which often go to the smaller concerns 
 firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide 
 council member <unk> <unk> the measure 's chief advocate considers it part of a <unk> policy that makes los angeles a leader in <unk> the workplace 
 november <unk> will contain few <unk> or initiative issues that especially affect small business 
 in san francisco small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ N million downtown baseball stadium they believe it will spur retail sales and <unk> business

 with some new rules state officials say they made it easier and faster to sell new <unk> whose terms <unk> from those in <unk> contracts 
 previously regulators insisted that franchisers <unk> such changes with the state a costly process taking at least six weeks 
 now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be <unk> 
 for instance franchisers no longer must <unk> sales to <unk> franchisees who qualify as sophisticated purchasers 
 such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ N million $ N annual income or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold 
 but critics consider the changes <unk> 
 lewis g. <unk> a chicago lawyer who represents franchisers contends california is narrowly limiting rather than expanding opportunities for negotiating sales 
 he argues california regulators historically have <unk> their law and he says negotiated sales that are n't <unk> have been legal all along

 about N commuters trying to find their way through the bay area 's <unk> transportation system <unk> <unk> into <unk> sat in traffic <unk> on major freeways or waited <unk> for buses yesterday 
 in other words it was a <unk> manhattan commute 
 city officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last tuesday 's earthquake 
 the massive temblor which killed at least N people <unk> the bay bridge a major artery to the east and closed most <unk> leading to and from highway N the biggest artery to the south 
 it will take several weeks to repair the bridge and several months to repair some of the N connections 
 but in spite of a <unk> <unk> gridlock never materialized mainly because the bay area rapid transit subway system carried N N more passengers than normal 
 for the first time in memory it was <unk> only in bart 's <unk> modern <unk> 
 moreover the two main bridges still connecting san francisco with the east bay did n't charge <unk> allowing traffic to zip through without <unk> 
 officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours or that many workers are still staying at home 
 many commuters who normally drove across the bay bridge which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span actually may have reached work a bit faster on bart yesterday provided they could find a parking space at the system 's <unk> stations 
 in the best of times the bay bridge is the worst commute in the region often experiencing <unk> of N to N minutes or more 
 not that getting into town was easy 
 storm flooding caused <unk> on the freeway and many commuters had to find <unk> to bart 's stations because parking lots were full before <unk> 
 bus schedules were sometimes in disarray <unk> commuters such as <unk> sullivan 
 her commute from <unk> calif. normally takes an hour and N minutes via the golden gate bridge which <unk> san francisco with the north bay area 
 yesterday she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district 
 it 's worse than i thought she said 
 i do n't know where all the buses are 
 but while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the golden gate by N a.m. it already had <unk> out 
 it 's one of the <unk> <unk> i 've ever had said charles <unk> an insurance broker on the bus from mill valley in <unk> county 
 it looks like a holiday 
 i think a lot of people got scared and stayed home 
 however a spokeswoman for bankamerica corp. said yesterday 's <unk> at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day 
 at the san mateo bridge which <unk> the san francisco peninsula with the east bay police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved 
 everybody pretty much pitched in and <unk> said <unk> <unk> a <unk> with the california highway <unk> 
 there were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role 
 the golden gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday but over four hours rather than the usual <unk> crush 
 <unk> group inc. the giant closely held engineering concern says it has instituted a N a.m. to N p.m. <unk> arrangement <unk> employees may select any <unk> period during those hours to go to work

 pacific gas & electric co. is offering its N san francisco employees a two-tier <unk> schedule either N a.m. to N p.m. or N a.m. to N p.m

 some of the utility 's employees may <unk> for a four-day <unk> N hours a day to cut the commute by N N 
 at pacific telesis group <unk> is left up to individual working groups because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business hours a spokeswoman says 
 some individuals went to some <unk> on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock 
 one senior vice president at <unk> said he got up at N a.m. to drive into san francisco from the east bay 
 but transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last 
 although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing an <unk> act about two-thirds of the <unk> crossing the golden gate were alone compared with the normal N N rate 
 and some commuters relieved by the absence of gridlock were planning to return to their old ways 
 <unk> kasparov went to combat sunday with the world 's most advanced <unk> computer and kicked it around <unk> anyway like an old <unk> can 
 playing black in the first game the human champion <unk> deep thought known for its attacking <unk> into a totally passive position 
 then he <unk> his own <unk> attack 
 and in the second game with mr. kasparov advancing <unk> as white d.t. offered <unk> resistance and lost even faster 
 well <unk> can rest easier for now 
 though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <unk> soviet to beat the <unk> computer he gave the machine a far worse <unk> than many expected 
 and when mr. kasparov <unk> into the playing hall he called the outcome 
 as if he were iron mike about to enter the ring with a <unk> <unk> he declared i 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years 
 his strategy against d.t. was based on a <unk> study of dozens of its games he said including its notorious <unk> of the <unk> <unk> larsen of <unk> and robert <unk> of the u.s. 
 mr. kasparov was <unk> 
 the computer 's mind is too straight too <unk> lacking the <unk> and creativity needed to reach the top he said 
 the champion apparently was not worried at all about d.t. 's strong points 
 its chief <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> the <unk> for its tactical <unk> at <unk> out of horrible positions 
 d.t. also has a <unk> and <unk> memory is utterly <unk> and could n't be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> spread around the playing hall in the new york academy of art 
 in fact d.t. never left home <unk> mellon university in pittsburgh but <unk> with its human <unk> by telephone link 
 they conceded that the odds favored mr. kasparov but they put their hope in d.t. 's recently enhanced capacity for <unk> positions up to a million per second from N 
 but the <unk> mistakenly stuck with silicon chips they needed <unk> 
 this became apparent as game one a <unk> defense by mr. kasparov <unk> 
 no human can examine millions of moves but mr. kasparov using his <unk> powerful brain consistently found very good ones 
 after eight moves by each side the board was the same as in a game in which nigel short of great britain fought the champion to a draw in N 
 but the computer did n't play mr. short 's ninth move a key pawn thrust and its position deteriorated rapidly 
 instead of <unk> a standard measure to <unk> the king d.t. made a <unk> <unk> maneuver at move N then it put a knight <unk> on move N 
 only two classes of minds would think of this very weak human players and computers said <unk> <unk> the expert <unk> for the match which was attended by hundreds of <unk> fans 
 by move N d.t. had fallen into a deep <unk> trap 
 it allowed mr. kasparov to exchange his <unk> <unk> for one of d.t. 's <unk> 
 <unk> usually are worth slightly more than <unk> but in this case mr. kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t. 's surviving <unk> was reduced to <unk> 
 indeed it looked more like a pawn a tall pawn as <unk> <unk> put it 
 consistently d.t. was <unk> about its chances which it continually <unk> up in <unk> form 
 when most <unk> thought its position <unk> the computer thought it was only in effect one-half of a pawn down 
 such <unk> met with <unk> and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have prompting more <unk> 
 while d.t. <unk> its king back and forth in a defensive <unk> mr. kasparov <unk> the knight to a dominant <unk> 
 he also launched a <unk> storm <unk> a pawn to <unk> d.t. 's king 
 no amount of <unk> could have saved this game for <unk> 
 a piece down the computer resigned 
 now with the crowd in the analysis room <unk> <unk> blood the only question seemed to be how fast mr. kasparov could win game two 
 with the advantage of playing white which moves first mr. kasparov followed up <unk> against the computer 's defense a queen 's <unk> accepted 
 as early as move six mr. kasparov <unk> from a well-known <unk> of moves developing a knight instead of making a standard <unk> attack against the computer 's advanced knight 
 this left the computer with a broader range of <unk> replies and it immediately <unk> by moving a <unk> pawn to the <unk> of <unk> development 
 in a new position just after the opening a computer will have serious problems mr. kasparov said later 
 in such positions he explained you have to create something new and the computer is n't able to do that right now 
 after only N moves for each side the computer 's position was shaky 
 <unk> it grabbed a pawn at the cost of facing a <unk> attack 
 and when a defensive move was called for d.t. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats 
 mr. kasparov <unk> later that even a weak club player would have avoided the queen move 
 now after only a dozen moves <unk> were looking for a <unk> combination 
 on a demonstration board <unk> <unk> <unk> showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice no <unk> <unk> this line of play 
 mr. kasparov 's <unk> was slower but in the end just as deadly 
 he won d.t. 's queen for two minor pieces and two <unk> not enough compensation in this position to give the computer much hope 
 in a <unk> position the computer resigned rather than make its <unk> move 
 and mr. kasparov to <unk> and applause marched back into the analysis room 
 in both games i got exactly what i wanted he said 
 what he had demonstrated he added is that there 's more to <unk> than sheer <unk> 
 <unk> d.t. 's <unk> vowed to press on 
 indeed three of them will be building a successor machine for international business machines corp 
 promises <unk> <unk> in three years we 'll mount a better challenge 
 mr. <unk> is a reporter in the journal 's new york bureau 
 reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in 
 just ask richard blumenfeld a new jersey <unk> who considers himself a reasonably sophisticated investor 
 in may N dr. blumenfeld gave merrill lynch & co. about $ N for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than N N 
 it was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly dr. blumenfeld recalls 
 yields on five-year cds at major banks were averaging about N N and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than N N 
 the cd seemed like a great deal 
 but nearly N N years later merrill says the investment is worth about $ N an amount that represents an annual return of just over N N on dr. blumenfeld 's $ N 
 the problem is that the cd he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain <unk> cd 
 instead his merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value 
 the difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return 
 more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or resale market 
 because the cd had an effective yield of N N when it was issued in N and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium an additional amount on top of the cd 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the cd 's increased market value 
 now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent and dr. blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance 
 the <unk> came when he opened a recent merrill lynch statement and found that the cd 's estimated current market value had plummeted by $ N in a month 
 several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later the <unk> found out that the $ N drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the cd and that the amount was n't insured 
 this is one thing i was never aware of he says 
 he assumed that principal and interest were fully insured up to $ N he adds 
 dr. blumenfeld is n't unique 
 especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of <unk> returns without fully <unk> the risk 
 yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things says john <unk> research director of the american association of individual investors a chicago-based educational group 
 the biggest problem we have is that investors realize after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in 
 dr. blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying 
 he says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon cd and that he had previously invested in <unk> treasury income growth receipts a type of zero-coupon treasury security sold by merrill lynch 
 but he says he did n't understand he was buying the cd on the secondary market and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks 
 the broker thomas <unk> of merrill lynch 's morristown n.j. office refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter referring inquiries to merrill lynch officials in new york 
 those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale 
 the fact sheet dated april N says on page three if the price paid for a cd purchased in the secondary market is higher than the <unk> value in the case of zero-coupon cds the difference is not insured 
 <unk> involving zero-coupon cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant 
 dr. blumenfeld says he does n't remember the <unk> about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium 
 i assumed i was buying a cd as a cd he says 
 nevertheless merrill lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued dr. blumenfeld 's cd peoples heritage federal savings & loan association in <unk> kan. is liquidated and the cd terminated the brokerage firm would cover the premium dr. blumenfeld paid 
 federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation to a maximum of $ N 
 it 's not a blanket commitment it 's a <unk> situation says albert <unk> a managing director of merrill lynch money markets inc 
 there 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks 
 we were n't sure that full disclosure as we wanted it was being made 
 merrill lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in dr. blumenfeld 's situation although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years 
 merrill lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells which it did n't provide in N 
 zero-coupon cds are only a small portion of the $ N <unk> in cds outstanding and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total 
 merrill lynch estimates that fewer than N financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon cds 
 still there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon cds with various maturities outstanding 
 because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued although interest is n't actually paid until maturity zero-coupon cds are usually sold for <unk> accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education 
 most zero-coupon cds are in maturities of six to nine years and they usually double in value by maturity 
 but investors who bought zero-coupon cds in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured 
 people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed 
 however those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon cds and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid 
 whatever the case a merrill lynch spokesman <unk> investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue unless the bank or thrift that issued the cd is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate 
 dr. blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved 
 and he says he 's learned a lesson you always have to watch out for yourself 
 no one else will watch out for you

 while franchisees were having a tough time holding sales mcdonald 's <unk> stores posted hefty gains for the nine months with sales per <unk> unit rising $ N

 carnival cruise lines inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a finnish <unk> would delay delivery of three big cruise ships 
 the miami-based company 's stock fell $ N yesterday to $ N a share in heavy american stock exchange composite trading 
 early yesterday carnival said in a company statement that it had been notified <unk> that waertsilae marine industries the finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships planned to file for bankruptcy 
 officials at carnival declined to comment 
 there is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect if any of all this is said john p. <unk> an analyst at raymond james associates inc 
 i did n't even know that a company in a <unk> country could file for bankruptcy 
 carnival said the fantasy the first of the three $ N million ships that carnival has on order is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean 
 that ship which would carry about N passengers would expand the capacity of carnival 's existing <unk> fleet by N N 
 the second ship which is <unk> is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N 
 there 's a N N chance that the fantasy will be delivered close to schedule said <unk> levy an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the others will probably be delivered as well but carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them 
 she said the company could pay as much as N N more for the ships 
 if the ships are n't delivered however it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the N fiscal year which begins dec. N 
 analysts said those estimates which range from about $ N a share to $ N a share are based on fantasy being in operation in N 
 if the ship fails to arrive those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed N cents or more 
 analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money carnival might lose through deposits 
 normally a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction 
 carnival for example has already paid about $ N million of the total cost for fantasy 
 some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it

 eaton corp. had a N N drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts its largest and most profitable single business 
 sales of medium and <unk> trucks continue to lag <unk> rates leading eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels said stephen r. <unk> vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer 
 he declined to make a specific earnings estimate 
 third-quarter net was $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because <unk> sales did n't rebound in september from the summer doldrums as they usually do said patrick e. <unk> analyst with mcdonald & co 
 mr. <unk> who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ N a share says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ N a share from his previous estimate of $ N 
 eli <unk> of painewebber inc. who a couple of weeks ago reduced his N estimate to $ N a share because of the weakening truck market says he will make another cut to about $ N a share in light of the third-quarter report 
 he said eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated 
 eaton said sales of truck <unk> <unk> and other parts fell N N to $ N million 
 sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose 
 eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell N N to $ N million on an about N N drop in sales to $ N million 
 mr. <unk> said <unk> operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy <unk> 
 the truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods he said and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward <unk> 
 operating profit from electrical and electronics controls eaton 's other major business group fell N N to $ N million despite a N N increase in sales to $ N million 
 the company attributed the decline to weakness in the <unk> market in north america and in the european <unk> market 
 for the nine months net including profit from discontinued operations both years and in N an extraordinary charge of $ N million related to settlement of a lawsuit was $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago

 in poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an <unk> alternative environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy cut <unk> <unk> and <unk> local politics 
 initial steps were taken at poland 's first international environmental conference which i attended last month 
 the conference held in lower <unk> was <unk> by the environment ministry the rockefeller brothers fund and the polish ecological club and was attended by N poles from government and industry as well as <unk> <unk> russians japanese and americans 
 the conference was entitled economic <unk> for environmental protection a significant departure from east bloc usage which recognizes only one economic mechanism central planning to direct industrial behavior 
 even more <unk> it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution notwithstanding poland 's lack of <unk> markets 
 why did east bloc participants unanimously <unk> <unk> pollution approaches 
 the answer lies both in the <unk> environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that <unk> 
 like other east bloc countries poland <unk> environmental laws more <unk> in their breach than in their <unk> 
 according to a detailed report by <unk> <unk> of the university of minnesota 's <unk> <unk> institute N areas containing a third of poland 's population are regarded as ecological hazards due to multiple violations of standards 
 <unk> are consistently exceeded at N N of <unk> <unk> monitoring sites and N N of those for dust and <unk> emissions 
 <unk> of poland 's <unk> have become highly <unk> N N of its southern <unk> are projected to die by century 's end 
 between N and N polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from N N to N N of all surface waters while those <unk> even for industry use nearly doubled 
 poland produces about N times more <unk> and five times more <unk> dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does western europe 
 its mortality rate for males over N is about N N higher than west germany 's and N N higher in hazard areas than the national average 
 since N average annual growth rates for most <unk> have <unk> the growth of gnp 
 conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from a marxist devaluation of environmental resources which are not produced by labor b planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government and c the continuing <unk> emphasis on heavy industry for economic development producing a far heavier and more <unk> use of energy and natural resources than in the west 
 they repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership genuine competition based on market factors and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions 
 the solutions they formally proposed included <unk> taxes conservation and recycling incentives <unk> <unk> <unk> pollution permits an ecological bank to finance <unk> credits and <unk> swaps 
 but their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state making it fully <unk> for pollution control 
 a revolution takes more than conference <unk> 
 indeed skepticism was <unk> captured by a joke told by poles at the conference the world must be coming to an end 
 the russians are talking peace 
 the <unk> are talking elections 
 and the poles are engaged in commerce 
 but the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce <unk> pollution or that the soviets plan to introduce <unk> pollution permits in some republics next year 
 those implications include privatization 
 faced with a $ N billion foreign debt and <unk> inflation poland must <unk> industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance 
 <unk> pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries 
 but it could also accelerate <unk> by reinforcing industrial accountability breaking up state monopolies giving managers a stake in solutions and ensuring that modernization is not <unk> for failure to address environmental effects 
 <unk> solutions 
 as conferees noted scarce capital means the costs of control must be <unk> through a broad <unk> of compliance choices for individual firms 
 that means simple clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction deferring more complex issues such as risk 
 it also means use of <unk> pollution limits such as <unk> permits rather than <unk> limits such as <unk> fees 
 that 's because <unk> managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals 
 creative financing 
 even <unk> environmental solutions will require billions of dollars 
 new types of financing must make funds available without <unk> poland 's <unk> reserves 
 <unk> 
 east bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets 
 while polish data have been freely available since N it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information 
 for once information flows public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to <unk> 
 global <unk> 
 one participant <unk> declared that america has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection while poland represents the opposite 
 his point it will be increasingly difficult for the u.s. to <unk> to <unk> measures if even the east bloc steps to a different <unk> 
 at the moment poland resembles <unk> pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society with <unk> production inadequate environmental management and little ecological awareness 
 but the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy

 why ca n't we teach our children to read write and <unk> 
 it 's not that we do n't know how to because we do 
 it 's that we do n't want to 
 and the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular as well as to violate some <unk> vested interests 
 these <unk> so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost <unk> to challenge them 
 here is an example 
 if i were to ask a sample of american parents do you wish the <unk> schools to encourage creativity in your children the <unk> answer would be yes of course 
 but what do we mean specifically by creativity 
 no one can say 
 in practice it ends up being <unk> with a <unk> that encourages the youngsters ' <unk> 
 the result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual <unk> is matched only by their good opinion of themselves 
 the whole notion of creativity in education was and is part and parcel of a romantic <unk> against disciplined instruction which was and is regarded as <unk> a repression and frustration of the <unk> <unk> and the wonderful if as yet <unk> <unk> inherent in the <unk> of all our children 
 it is not surprising that parents find this romantic <unk> so attractive 
 fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands 
 their commitment to creativity can not survive <unk> <unk> 
 american education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we all of us allow this common sense to prevail over the <unk> that we also share 
 the education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way 
 the reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated 
 <unk> education as it was once called is far more interesting and <unk> to teachers than is disciplined instruction 
 it is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in <unk> development and even <unk> to minimize those <unk> tests with often disappointing results 
 it also provides teachers with a superior <unk> as a profession since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy 
 i myself took such courses in college thinking i might end up a <unk> 
 they could all fairly be described as <unk> courses 
 but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment 
 i know many <unk> and on the whole they are seriously committed to <unk> teaching 
 they may not be among the best and <unk> of their generation there are very few such people by definition 
 but they need not be to do their jobs well 
 yes we all can remember one or two truly <unk> teachers from our school days 
 but our education <unk> at the hands of those others who were merely competent and <unk> 
 in this sense a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor 
 if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place 
 if he is competent and <unk> he serves us well 
 our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis 
 whether they are or are not <unk> is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem 
 it is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more 
 it is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading for their own narrow purposes 
 it is also the kind of libel politicians find useful since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency 
 but there is not one <unk> of evidence that other things being equal salary <unk> result in educational <unk> 
 if there were such evidence you can be sure you would have heard of it 
 if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do and just as important what not to do 
 there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of <unk> and they are all sending us the same message 
 <unk> there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed <unk> 
 we really do know all we need to know if only we could <unk> this knowledge into our thinking 
 in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were <unk> rather than <unk> concerned 
 they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional <unk> since this is the least controversial option that is open to them 
 thus at the recent governors ' conference on education gov. bill clinton of arkansas announced that this country needs a comprehensive <unk> policy for children under five 
 a comprehensive development policy for governors over N would seem to be a more pressing need 
 what gov. clinton is <unk> in effect is extending the educational system down to the <unk> years 
 whether desirable or not this is a child-care program not an educational program 
 we know that very early exposure to <unk> improves performance in the first grade but afterward the difference is quickly <unk> away 
 let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work parental involvement is a bad idea 
 parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children 
 parents should be involved with their children 's education at home not in school 
 they should see to it that their kids do n't play <unk> they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing <unk> they should <unk> the report card 
 if parents are <unk> with a school they should have the option of switching to another 
 community involvement is an even worse idea 
 here the experience of new york city is decisive 
 locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the <unk> of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably <unk> local politicians or would-be politicians 
 new york is in the process of trying to <unk> itself from a <unk> commitment to this system of school <unk> even as chicago and other cities are moving to institute it 
 in most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better 
 the reason is simple education takes place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal 
 decades of educational research tell us <unk> that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the <unk> though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons 
 the new money flows into the already <unk> administrative structure which <unk> itself <unk> more and more paper work on the teachers 
 there is neither mystery nor <unk> in the fact that as educational expenditures in real terms have increased sharply in the past <unk> we now spend more per <unk> than any other country in the world educational performance has declined 
 that is the way the system works 
 students should move up the educational <unk> as their academic potential allows 
 no student should be permitted to be <unk> from <unk> school without having <unk> the N r 's at the level that prevailed N years ago 
 this means tracking whose main purpose is less to permit the <unk> youngsters to <unk> though that is clearly desirable than to ensure that the less <unk> get the necessary <unk> for further study or for entering the modern world of work 
 the notion that tracking is somehow <unk> is absurd 
 the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential 
 no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential 
 it is generally desirable to use older <unk> many of them <unk> out of print rather than newer ones 
 the latter are <unk> trendy often downright silly and at best <unk> 
 they are based on dubious psychological and <unk> theories rather than on educational experience 
 one of the reasons american students do so poorly in <unk> tests as compared with british french german or japanese students is the influence of the new <unk> on american <unk> and teaching methods 
 anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is with students who ca n't add or <unk> learning the conceptual basis of <unk> theory should read the article by <unk> nelson himself a recent <unk> major at harvard in the november american <unk> 
 most important of all schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty the <unk> and all matters of student discipline 
 study after study the most recent from the <unk> institution tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside <unk> and are <unk> by a powerful head 
 with that authority of course goes an <unk> accountability 
 schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance 
 this is a fact though in view of all the <unk> that are <unk> by this fact it is not surprising that one <unk> so little about it

 international business machines corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when <unk> their operations most machines ca n't talk to each other 
 the company unveiled more than N products mostly software that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation the plant floor design operations and production planning 
 the aim ultimately is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning marketing and other operations 
 manufacturers have already spent so heavily on <unk> that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources 
 but many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been <unk> nearly impossible by the <unk> of computer <unk> used by different machines including robots and machine tools 
 ibm 's announcement which was expected and will formally be made to customers today also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor where digital equipment corp. has long dominated and where hewlett-packard co. has recently gained market share 
 consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the ibm strategy to fall into place even though the specific products ibm unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter 
 sam albert a consultant in <unk> n.y. said that in the past ibm has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines 
 he said he believes ibm 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology 
 he said he expects ibm to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months 
 ibm 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing 
 rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors ibm is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs 
 ibm 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that ibm has developed <unk> and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems 
 ibm can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents 
 we may not have every manufacturing problem but we have most said george <unk> ibm 's top marketing official

 the tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act 
 largely to meet tougher new capital requirements thrifts reduced their assets $ N billion in august by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans 
 industry assets as of aug. N were $ N trillion the lowest since august N 
 as thrifts sell assets to improve their <unk> ratio as required under the new law passed in august they must also reduce liabilities such as deposits 
 as interest rates paid <unk> were lowered thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion not including interest credited to accounts 
 it was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in <unk> to their assets the office of thrift supervision said 
 the asset <unk> was particularly concentrated in several large california institutions 
 the <unk> of the thrift industry is well under way said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant in <unk> va 
 this suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have <unk> so soon 
 james <unk> an economist with the office of thrift supervision also attributed some of the <unk> to seasonal factors 
 august is a month when people are paying school tuition he said 
 that and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry 
 not including thrifts under government conservatorship s&ls reduced their assets by $ N billion from the previous month and deposit outflows totaled $ N billion 
 for the N insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of august assets declined by $ N billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion 
 thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities which were reduced by $ N billion in august from the prior month 
 as of aug. N thrifts held $ N billion in mortgage-backed securities 
 the deposit numbers for august marked a swing back to huge outflows after a july net deposit <unk> of $ N million the only net <unk> in more than a year 
 deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future as the industry continues to shrink 
 i think we are going to see deposit <unk> continue unless we see big changes in rates mr. <unk> said 
 for the first eight months of N thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion 
 for the prior year deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ N billion 
 the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly <unk> the rate of economic growth 
 since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the <unk> for the productivity ratios calculated by the department of labor underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics 
 if this <unk> is correct it has important implications for <unk> policies it may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real gnp 
 it would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the informed public generally as to what <unk> a reasonable degree of price stability 
 in the early 1980s i predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade 
 this forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces such as <unk> changes the oil shock and accelerating inflation that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s 
 there has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since N 
 but i had expected more which is one reason i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates 
 the evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the N period but all i am claiming is that the growth trend is <unk> 
 it is however possible that further study will reveal increasing bias 
 this bias is in no way <unk> 
 the <unk> of growth is due largely to the conservative <unk> adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data 
 the first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates mainly employment or hours instead of output estimates for those sectors such as governments paid household services and private <unk> institutions where there are difficulties in <unk> output data 
 this means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor 
 in an unrelated program in which the labor department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of N N during the 1980s 
 even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the <unk> sector this labor department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real gnp estimates of N percentage point a year on average 
 the federal productivity <unk> use labor input rather than output data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well 
 independent estimates of output in those industries including one by the department of labor for banking suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least N N a year between N and N 
 because finance and services contribute N N to final business product missing these productivity improvements <unk> the overall growth rate by N N a year 
 the second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate <unk> to adjust for price changes 
 i estimate that these <unk> as detailed by martin n. <unk> and robert j. gordon add a further N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product 
 finally the official estimates <unk> growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services 
 in N a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance <unk> was introduced and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed 
 since then further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate 
 in sum the <unk> <unk> above indicate a N percentage point <unk> in growth of total real gnp 
 for the private domestic business economy the bias was a bit over N percentage point 
 in other words the growth rates of both total gnp and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about N N

 union carbide corp. said third-quarter net income plunged N N from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business 
 net was $ N million or N cents a share for the quarter compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion the previous year 
 carbide like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong N third quarter 
 but the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on wall street 
 it certainly was n't a disaster but it does show weakness in some of the company 's chief markets said george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading carbide closed at $ N a share down N cents 
 prices for polyethylene a common plastic and an important carbide product started to fall early this year the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories 
 prices also fell for <unk> <unk> and <unk> products used in making <unk> 
 some producers of polyethylene figuring the inventory reductions are near an end have announced price boosts 
 the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective 
 a carbide spokesman said the conditions are right for the increase to hold 
 for the third quarter operating profit from carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ N million from $ N million a year ago before accounting for taxes and interest expense 
 operating profit from carbon products such as <unk> <unk> also declined to $ N million from $ N million 
 in the <unk> segment operating profit climbed to $ N million from $ N million 
 the latest quarter included a gain of about $ N million on the sale of the company 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> businesses 
 <unk> <unk> are used in making <unk> products such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> are used in making the <unk> foam found in furniture <unk> and other products 
 that gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ N million from a write-down in its <unk> business 
 <unk> is used in making integrated circuits

 at least N states are <unk> drexel burnham lambert inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders 
 the reluctance of some states to let drexel off the hook could <unk> the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six <unk> last month say several people familiar with the discussions 
 up to now drexel has made a <unk> series of settlements with N states and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
 just yesterday new hampshire announced it made a $ N settlement with drexel a <unk> fine for a <unk> matter in that state 
 these states have been entering into settlements with drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the u.s. despite its record as an admitted <unk> 
 but individuals familiar with the generally successful drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri 
 officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by drexel 
 they question if drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small <unk> firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely <unk> 
 drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission that includes payment of $ N million in penalties 
 these stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on wall street 
 ohio the district of columbia tennessee and illinois have been less <unk> to drexel than the other six states but nonetheless have refused to settle so far say those familiar with the discussions 
 drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be <unk> and even if some are its securities business would n't be directly hurt 
 it already has sold its retail or <unk> brokerage network securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for <unk> activities such as investment banking 
 still if nothing else a <unk> brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which drexel could be involved 
 securities regulators <unk> drexel for its energetic effort led by <unk> general counsel saul s. cohen to settle its legal problems with the states 
 but they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public 
 there was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue said susan bryant oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the north american securities administrators association which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with drexel 
 the question she said is whether drexel should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony 
 while ms. bryant 's state went ahead and accepted drexel 's settlement offer of $ N she said i do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions 
 i can see both sides 
 similarly alfred <unk> new hampshire 's director of securities regulation said his state had n't received any complaints about drexel so it really could n't press the issue 
 still i understand the reasons that other states are holding out he said 
 mr. cohen the drexel general counsel said i do n't think as we say in investment banking that by the end of the day we 'll be losing any licenses 
 asked about states that are taking a hard line he said there are states that have asked for additional information which we are providing to them 
 mr. cohen said more than $ N million has been paid to N states and that drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ N million 
 by the end of this week drexel should have another three to four settlements mr. cohen said 
 the rate we 're going i think that by the end of the month we 're looking to have a total of N to N he said 
 that total would be important for drexel 
 the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry 
 a <unk> to that promise is that a minimum of N states reach settlement agreements before next tuesday 
 there are according to several securities commissioners at least N states that are either close to settlements with drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling 
 drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state 
 new jersey for example was asked to accept $ N but refused 
 the state is n't ruling out <unk> drexel 's brokerage license 
 the state can also bar drexel as an investment adviser 
 state officials wo n't describe their position in detail but james <unk> smith state securities chief said we really are still looking at it and have informed drexel that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement 
 connecticut already has issued a notice of intent to revoke drexel 's brokerage license 
 it is one of the states that have met with mr. cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters 
 this particular issue goes to the very integrity of the <unk> market state banking commissioner howard brown said 
 a banking department spokesman added commissioner brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here 
 particularly touchy are the cases of new york which is drexel 's base and california the base of drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties 
 neither state has settled and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so 
 but drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is <unk> according to state officials 
 ms. bryant the head of the state securities group said drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than <unk> hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive <unk> scheme several years ago 
 still she said drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing 
 this process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business ms. bryant said 
 we need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again 
 these are the N states including the commonwealth of puerto rico that have settled with drexel alaska arkansas delaware georgia hawaii idaho indiana iowa kansas kentucky maine maryland minnesota mississippi new hampshire new mexico north <unk> oklahoma oregon south carolina south <unk> utah vermont washington wyoming and puerto rico

 time warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining warner shares 
 time warner emphasized in a news release that it should be <unk> based on its cash flow which the company defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 
 on a <unk> basis assuming the merger was effective jan N N including the results from both time inc. and all of warner that cash flow figure would be $ N million for the latest quarter more than double the comparable figure a year ago or $ N million according to time warner

 what really matters is the operating income of the divisions i look at these numbers and i say these businesses are doing well said mark <unk> a vice president of donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 for example warner made more than $ N million from <unk> entertainment in three months 
 that 's a big number 
 warner also had a gain of more than N N from records and music publishing even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer

 in addition the N results included a $ N million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at american television & communications corp 
 on the other hand time warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division its books division and the home box office programming division 
 in magazines higher advertising revenues at sports illustrated and fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines 
 the programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ N million dividend from turner broadcasting system and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the nov. N launch of hbo 's comedy channel

 mr. werner N was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit 
 moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company 
 the <unk> concern cited the bank 's move into the texas market noting its profitability and capital <unk> measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance 
 moody 's also said it raised its rating on the deposit insurance bridge bank now known as bank one texas <unk> reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the fdic 
 officials at the new york bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the <unk> changes 
 at lloyd 's of london underwriters still <unk> out policies using <unk> <unk> and <unk> paper 
 visitors are <unk> into the premises by <unk> <unk> known as <unk> a reminder of the insurance market 's <unk> in a <unk> in <unk> century london 
 such <unk> suggest a <unk> past but give no hint of a troubled present 
 lloyd 's once a <unk> of the world insurance market is being shaken to its very foundation 
 the <unk> exchange is battered by enormous claims from a <unk> run of unprecedented disasters the most recent of which is last week 's earthquake in california 's bay area 
 at the same time lloyd 's is besieged by <unk> investors and <unk> by inefficient but <unk> ways of conducting business 
 the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow <unk> segments of the market by less <unk> competitors 
 lloyd 's is on the ropes says peter <unk> a lloyd 's investor for N years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged <unk> and negligence 
 it needs more discipline 
 it needs to sort itself out 
 most troublesome is the shrinking pool of names the <unk> investors some of them royal who as members of about N syndicates underwrite policies 
 some N members quit the exchange last year more than triple the number of resignations in N 
 names are resigning at an even faster pace this year 
 lackluster returns are one reason 
 the average after-tax return on investment in N the most recent year for which results are available was N N according to <unk> ltd. an insurance consulting firm in london 
 in N it was N N 
 between N and N the most recent five-year period for which figures are available lloyd 's reported over # N billion in claims and reserves against future losses $ N billion at today 's exchange rates more than double the # N billion posted in the previous five-year period 
 many of the N investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic <unk> the concept of <unk> personal liability 
 investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe 
 and catastrophes are getting ever more costly 
 lloyd 's claims for the N <unk> <unk> <unk> disaster in the north sea for instance may reach $ N billion 
 during the five-year period ended N roughly N N of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates according to <unk> consultants 
 the <unk> of <unk> liability looms large for a number of them now 
 i have <unk> i could die and be out of it that 's how bad it is <unk> <unk> a secretary from suburban london says 
 ms. <unk> whose lloyd 's membership was a bonus from a former employer in N belongs to mr. <unk> 's dissident group on the <unk> syndicate which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims 
 ms. <unk> who <unk> # N or about $ N of insurance coverage on that syndicate now faces potential losses of roughly # N or $ N 
 if lloyd 's wants # N out of me they will have to take everything i 've got and even then i do n't know if it will be enough she says 
 <unk> is widespread among exchange members 
 i ca n't think of any reason to join lloyd 's now says keith whitten a british businessman and a lloyd 's member since N 
 the downside is very considerable and at the moment the upside is very marginal 
 if profits do n't improve mr. whitten says he may quit the exchange 
 meanwhile competition from rivals <unk> by history is <unk> 
 lloyd 's is being squeezed out of <unk> but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance 
 over the past decade competitors have <unk> away at the exchange 's share of the # N billion marine market in london where half the world 's ships are insured 
 lloyd 's N N stake in that market has <unk> to N N in that period according to an official at the institute of london underwriters a lloyd 's competitor 
 the official asked not to be named 
 much of the business has gone to the institute an association of more than N insurers including cigna corp. allianz <unk> ag of west germany and britain 's commercial union assurance plc 
 lloyd 's has <unk> decades of <unk> decline 
 at the peak of its power and influence a century ago lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a N N stake 
 it virtually <unk> how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a <unk> intelligence network in ports around the globe 
 today lloyd 's share of the world market excluding life insurance is about N N 
 its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included 
 bigger rivals such as aetna and allianz backed by <unk> of <unk> using computers in hundreds of branches operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates brokers say 
 though lloyd 's <unk> such <unk> policies as worker 's compensation insurance <unk> insurance for homeowners and businesses and bankers ' liability insurance competitors now underwrite most of that business 
 beyond that many big oil chemical and airline companies are <unk> off big chunks of the market by <unk> themselves through <unk> offshore companies for <unk> coverage 
 even lloyd 's specialty unusually risky ventures is being challenged 
 only N years ago for instance lloyd 's was the <unk> insurer of thoroughbred horses 
 but since N kirk horse insurance inc. of lexington ky. has grabbed a N N stake of the market 
 ronald kirk president says lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients brokers are required <unk> 
 thus he asserts lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition 
 lloyd 's has lost control of the situation he says 
 they are n't controlling their <unk> like they used to 
 murray lawrence lloyd 's chairman agrees the exchange faces big challenges 
 this is a <unk> time and we are trying to plot our way ahead he says 
 we have been a great market for <unk> risks which other people then take copy and cut rates 
 lloyd 's he says is cut off from the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a <unk> influence against catastrophic losses 
 by that he means <unk> but <unk> products such as certain types of primary property insurance 
 the exchange he says must find new products and new markets 
 that wo n't be an easy task 
 tradition is dictator at lloyd 's 
 three years ago the exchange took up residence in a <unk> tower of steel and glass <unk> of the kind of modern architecture that britain 's prince charles has denounced 
 some exchange <unk> call the building the oil rig 
 but along with such <unk> <unk> as lord nelson 's <unk> lloyd 's also brought its <unk> ways of doing business 
 the lloyd 's market actively <unk> insurance just N N hours a day brokers say 
 underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at N a.m 
 a <unk> lunch break follows 
 things wind down at about N p.m. just in time for afternoon tea 
 lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of <unk> desks 
 the hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages 
 <unk> between desks underwriters sit on <unk> surrounded by <unk> of policies 
 brokers <unk> thick <unk> stand in lines waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters 
 a broker may have to approach as many as N underwriters who insure the <unk> on behalf of the syndicates 
 it could take six months for a claim to be paid 
 the system says nicholas <unk> a lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in N is so <unk> <unk> it drives you mad 
 some maintain underwriters also have been <unk> 
 john <unk> a lloyd 's underwriter says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as N N the premiums they should have charged for property risks from N to N 
 how <unk> we must have appeared to the outside world how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation he says 
 lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter 
 more recently property rates have increased 
 many at lloyd 's expect the san francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further 
 but it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters 
 the magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims 
 lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for N 
 that year it posted record pretax profit of # N million a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims 
 but mr. lawrence says reported profit will be down in N N and N though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be 
 insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be <unk> by more than $ N million in aviation losses including the N pan am airline disaster over <unk> scotland and a <unk> chunk of claims from september 's hurricane hugo 
 lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity currently about # N billion 
 mr. lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names 
 meanwhile the exchange has been trying to lower costs 
 it recently cut its work force by N N or N 
 but lloyd 's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to <unk> modern technology 
 mr. <unk> the underwriter <unk> half of his business could be <unk> by computer cutting costs at least N N 
 though lloyd 's has talked for years about <unk> underwriting transactions the effort has n't gotten very far 
 competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to <unk> price and policy information 
 both groups <unk> to traditional face-to-face dealings even for routine policies 
 lloyd 's <unk> bureaucracy also <unk> efforts to update marketing strategies 
 some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the <unk> business by selling some policies directly to consumers 
 lloyd 's <unk> sells only auto insurance directly to the public and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the u.k. and canada 
 but such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters brokers and administrators before being implemented 
 the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic <unk> 
 lloyd 's is moving forward on some fronts though 
 mr. lawrence says the exchange is <unk> some procedures to make <unk> payments on claims 
 by next year all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims 
 japan 's daiwa securities co. named <unk> dozen president 
 mr. dozen succeeds <unk> <unk> who will become vice chairman 
 <unk> <unk> retains his title of chairman of daiwa japan 's second-largest securities firm 
 in japanese firms the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations while the chairman 's role is more a <unk> one 
 the title of chief executive officer is n't used 
 while people within daiwa particularly <unk> expected that mr. dozen N would eventually become daiwa 's president the speed of his promotion surprised many 
 it was only earlier this year that the <unk> <unk> executive he likes to joke with americans about how his name is <unk> with twelve was appointed deputy president 
 mr. dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing 
 daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms 
 as of march N the daiwa group had shareholder equity of N billion yen $ N billion 
 for the six months ended sept. N daiwa reported unconsolidated parent company net income of N billion yen $ N million on revenue of N billion yen $ N billion 
 both figures were record highs 
 several observers interpreted mr. dozen 's appointment as an attempt by daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of japan 's domestic markets which should mean increased competition 
 all of japan 's so-called big four securities firms nomura securities co. ltd. the world 's largest nikko securities co. ltd. yamaichi securities co. ltd. and daiwa have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets 
 while they have moved to the <unk> in underwriting fixed-income securities in the <unk> market mostly for japanese firms they have been only marginally profitable if at all in the u.s. 
 american institutional investors have never had a large appetite for japanese equities 
 and while the japanese have stepped up their purchases of u.s. shares in the past several months they have shown themselves in the past to be <unk> investors 
 at the same time daiwa and its <unk> have faced stiff competition from <unk> american competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to u.s. corporations and institutional investors 
 mr. dozen knows these problems <unk> 
 when he arrived in the u.s. in N the start of an <unk> tour he tried selling japanese <unk> bonds to u.s. investors 
 he made desperate efforts using the yellow pages from beginning to end said <unk> <unk> president of daiwa 's u.s. unit 
 but not a single piece of paper was sold 
 by his own account mr. dozen did n't do much better with u.s. bonds 
 in an interview a few months ago he recalled how after some training at salomon brothers inc. he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of N u.s. corporate bond issues 
 but he could n't sell any 
 japanese stock salesmen selling american bonds 
 maybe it 's crazy he said 
 mr. dozen even related the <unk> suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing <unk> off the new jersey shore and caught nothing 
 upon returning to new york exhausted i got into a <unk> and the woman driver said americans make better <unk> he recalled 
 <unk> mr. dozen said that daiwa 's goal is to build a high-technology <unk> international organization with maybe some japanese flavor to it 
 he said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures options <unk> securities computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions 
 mr. dozen said daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base its influential position in the tokyo market and its links to japanese corporations and institutional investors 
 mr. dozen joined daiwa upon his <unk> from <unk> university in N 
 like many young <unk> in japanese securities firms he began his career peddling stock to individual investors 
 in his climb to the top mr. dozen also headed the company 's <unk> division its fixed-income units and its international operations 
 he was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience he is very <unk> said <unk> <unk> chairman of daiwa 's u.s. unit in new york 
 but it mr. dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support particularly from the retail sales force to <unk> to the presidency 
 commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of japanese securities companies ' earnings 
 and anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force would be fragile said a daiwa executive 
 if mr. dozen has a weakness it may be his golf game 
 he digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball like a farmer said mr. <unk> 
 inco ltd. posted a N N decline in third-quarter net income a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations 
 the nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to N cents a share from N cents and said it may buy back as much as N N of its common outstanding 
 inco shares fell after the announcements 
 analysts said some investors were disappointed that the <unk> company had failed to announce a special dividend 
 inco closed at $ N a share down N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 some analysts said inco which had cash reserves of $ N million as of sept. N could still announce a special dividend in the next few months though it would be smaller than the $ <unk> special dividend it paid last year 
 the quarterly dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N 
 inco 's net fell to $ N million or $ N a share in the third quarter from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 excluding special gains from tax-loss <unk> earnings in the latest quarter were $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share 
 inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's manitoba operations due to high levels of <unk> in the <unk> 
 inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next N months if nickel market conditions are favorable 
 under a previous <unk> program inco has purchased N million of its shares since april 
 ual corp. 's board <unk> any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out saying united airlines ' parent should remain independent for now 
 as a result ual 's chairman stephen m. wolf pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company 
 the two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of <unk> matters including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility 
 the effort to create the nation 's largest <unk> company began <unk> oct. N when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share $ N billion offer 
 just last week it suffered another major setback when british airways plc the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid withdrew its support 
 takeover stock traders focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent took the announcement as bad news 
 ual which had risen $ N to $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group reversed course and plummeted in <unk> trading after the N p.m. edt announcement 
 among the first trades reported by the securities firm of jefferies & co. which makes a market in ual after the exchange is closed were N shares at $ N N shares at $ N N at $ N and N at $ N 
 the rebound in ual stock during regular trading hours monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price N N below its level before oct. N the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal 
 twelve of ual 's outside directors met at a <unk> meeting yesterday in chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid 
 but the board said it was n't interested for now 
 that proposal valued at between $ N and $ N a share would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands 
 the buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan 
 and with no other offers on the table the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it 
 the directors signaled however that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value saying they would continue to explore all strategic and financial alternatives 
 but it was clear that for the time being the board wants the company to return to <unk> 
 the board said it concluded that the welfare of the company its shareholders its employees and the broader public can best be enhanced by continued development of ual as a strong viable independent company 
 mr. wolf urged all employees to now turn their full attention to operating the airline 
 he also vowed to make every effort to <unk> a <unk> new relationship that has been <unk> with participating employee groups 
 but mr. wolf faces a <unk> task in pulling the company back together again 
 labor problems top the list 
 for a brief time the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with united 's pilot union 
 in return for an ownership stake in the company the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a <unk> clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted 
 that contract was tied to the success of the buy-out 
 as a <unk> measure the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly ual 's two new boeing N aircraft 
 it 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement 
 the union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort still need to be addressed 
 the buy-out effort also <unk> <unk> relations between united 's pilot and <unk> unions 
 the machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction 
 the machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to mr. wolf but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he <unk> up with the pilot union 
 the machinists criticized the terms mr. wolf and management received in the buy-out 
 they paid $ N million for a N N stake and received an additional N N of the company at no additional cost 
 his credibility is also on the line in the investment community 
 until the collapse of this bid mr. wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's <unk> airline executives after engineering <unk> of tiger international inc. and republic airlines 
 but he and his chief financial officer john pope <unk> some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ N million they stood to gain from sale of their ual stock and options 
 the board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ N million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer 
 it also inevitably leaves a <unk> of shareholder lawsuits 
 arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value 
 one takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote 
 the machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees 
 los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer for ual in august triggered a bidding war says he remains interested in the airline 
 however he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential ual data 
 essentially he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ N a share 
 tandy corp. said it wo n't join u.s. memories the group that seeks to battle the japanese in the market for computer memory chips 
 tandy 's decision is a second setback for u.s. memories 
 last month apple computer inc. said that it would n't invest in the group 
 apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development 
 u.s. memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ N billion market for dynamic random access memory chips a market dominated by the japanese 
 those chips were in dire shortage last year hurting many u.s. computer companies that could n't get sufficient <unk> chips 
 tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ N million to $ N million investment u.s. memories is seeking from each investor 
 at this time we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need for <unk> from the market as a rule said ed <unk> tandy 's director of market planning 
 sanford kane u.s. memories president said the decision was disappointing but does n't <unk> u.s. memories ' failure 
 i would like to have had them he said 
 but they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it 
 mr. kane became president and chief executive officer of u.s. memories last june when the group was formed by seven electronics companies advanced micro devices inc. digital equipment corp. hewlett-packard co. intel corp. international business machines corp. lsi logic corp. and national semiconductor corp 
 mr. kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in u.s. memories soon after the group <unk> a business plan probably late this week 
 u.s. memories needs a catalyst he said to <unk> others to join 
 but so far most potential participants have n't decided 
 sun microsystems inc. said it 's still actively evaluating u.s. memories and plans to meet with u.s. memories representatives later this week 
 american telephone & telegraph co. said it was waiting to see u.s. memories ' business plan 
 personal-computer maker <unk> research inc. said it is still studying the situation 
 a compaq computer corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet although it is n't under active consideration 
 in a startling <unk> members of the senate intelligence committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is <unk> on them 
 david boren the intelligence committee chairman is upset that someone <unk> a letter to the committee from the reagan administration suggesting that the u.s. would <unk> to warn panamanian <unk> manuel noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination 
 with due respect to highly classified <unk> and other <unk> the <unk> are performing a public service 
 if the cia has become a protection service for mr. noriega the american people ought to know 
 what went wrong in panama is a <unk> subject for public and congressional inquiry 
 naturally senator boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while <unk> top secret on their own <unk> 
 but there 's no danger of <unk> sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down pennsylvania avenue 
 and if congress is going to assume authority to <unk> foreign policy it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too 
 the president of the united states urged the panamanian armed forces to move against mr. noriega 
 when they did his <unk> did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads 
 the executive branch bears the first responsibility for <unk> 
 but what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by congress 
 for example what exactly did the cia tell major <unk> and his fellow coup <unk> about u.s. laws and executive orders on assassinations 
 what part did u.s. warnings play in the major 's <unk> to pull the trigger when he had general noriega in custody but was under attack by <unk> troops 
 mr. noriega did n't suffer from any <unk> once he had the <unk> 
 maybe we need a cia version of the <unk> warning you have the right to <unk> your coup intentions because we may <unk> on you 
 or maybe a surgeon general 's warning <unk> in the united states may be fatal 
 cia chief william webster hardly a washington <unk> got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to u.s. <unk> during the coup 
 the cia 's deputy director of operations richard <unk> tried to smooth things over a few days later but instead simply <unk> mr. webster 's point 
 the interpretation of the executive order mr. <unk> said and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators including me 
 in other words congress wo n't let the cia do much of anything anymore and that 's fine with the cia 
 the pay 's the same and the duty 's lighter 
 and of course doing anything that might be <unk> by congress carries heavy penalties 
 witness the <unk> prosecution of <unk> north 
 the intelligence committee 's ranking republican senator william cohen joined with senator george mitchell to write a best seller about iran-contra <unk> men of <unk> 
 no doubt many people in the cia the pentagon and the national security council have read it 
 what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail 
 who wants to end up as the <unk> in a bill cohen <unk> play 
 the order against assassinations is another <unk> of the same congressional <unk> a product of the 1970s vietnam syndrome against any executive action 
 president bush would do himself and the country a favor by <unk> the order as an <unk> <unk> on his ability to defend america 's national security 
 there are of course good reasons the u.s. should n't get into the assassination business but <unk> the executive order is not the same thing as saying the u.s. should start passing out <unk> <unk> 
 the world being the nasty place it is we want presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed 
 in such situations you can not write rules in advance you can only make sure the president takes the responsibility 
 the executive order and the reported agreements with the intelligence committee are neither <unk> nor moral 
 as it now stands the u.s. can bomb <unk> but ca n't <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it can send a fighter <unk> to <unk> terrorist <unk> in the <unk> valley but ca n't shoot <unk> <unk> 
 both the assassination order and the quality of debate in washington are telling the world that the only way the u.s. will kill a <unk> is by making sure we take some innocent <unk> with him 
 we 've heard california 's <unk> proposition N blamed for a lot over the years but abc 's ted <unk> came up with a new <unk> in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked democratic <unk> richard katz if <unk> N had withheld money needed for road maintenance 
 mr. katz <unk> agreed sliding over the fact that california 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes 
 both have been raised at least N N in recent years even while the price of gasoline has fallen 
 dragging <unk> N into this story is a pretty long stretch 
 a series of explosions <unk> through the huge phillips petroleum co. plastics plant near here <unk> more than a hundred and closing parts of the houston ship channel 
 there were no immediate reports of deaths but officials said a number of workers were still <unk> for last night 
 the <unk> okla. oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires which sent columns of heavy black smoke <unk> high into the air

 the injured including three in critical condition were treated for burns breathing problems and cuts from flying glass hospital officials said

 yesterday 's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant 
 in late august four contract workers were injured and one phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house 
 the phillips facility manufactures polyethylene <unk> and <unk> plastics used in a wide array of applications including milk <unk> and toys 
 plastics are the <unk> of phillips ' chemicals operations which is the biggest single <unk> to the company 's profits 
 a federal judge in manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $ N representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the international <unk> of <unk> 
 manhattan u.s. attorney <unk> <unk> said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any <unk> from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law 
 joseph <unk> who the government alleged was the <unk> of organized crime in chicago was one of numerous defendants in the government 's sweeping racketeering suit against the <unk> 
 in the suit filed in june N the government accused the union 's leadership of <unk> its N million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering 
 among other things the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely <unk> the union 's top officials

 <unk> hess corp. and occidental petroleum corp. reported higher earnings 
 exxon 
 although exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the alaskan <unk> <unk> by its huge oil spill those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing <unk> program are covered by $ N million in charges taken during the first half 
 an exxon official said that at this time the oil company does n't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil <unk> when one of its <unk> <unk> into an <unk> <unk> 
 she added however that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill 
 she said that impact ca n't be reasonably assessed yet 
 exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ N billion or N cents a share from $ N billion or N cents a share a year earlier

 both men fit the mood of the times the mood being one of a public fed up with officials ' <unk> for why their schools do n't work 
 former patterson n.j. principal joe clark was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of <unk> administrator 
 the subject of the movie lean on me mr. clark controlled his school with a <unk> and a baseball bat

 it means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals

 ingersoll publications co. agreed to buy the new haven register in a transaction valued at $ N million from goodson newspaper group inc 
 as part of the agreement goodson also terminated the contract under which ingersoll manages goodson 's N newspapers ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently 
 goodson has accused ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the st. louis sun 
 under the terms of the accord ingersoll will pay about $ N million for the register a daily that goodson bought for about $ N million in N 
 goodson will pay the additional $ N million in settlement of the management contract 
 goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of ingersoll to run the goodson papers 
 both executives left the company after <unk> with chairman ralph ingersoll jr 
 goodson which is based here will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the morristown daily record for $ N million in N 
 the new jersey paper like the new haven conn. paper was purchased by ingersoll on goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract 
 industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high causing a strain on goodson 's finances 
 investment bankers familiar with the company said goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ N million and may have to sell additional newspapers 
 david n. <unk> president and chief operating officer of goodson said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers 
 goodson said david carr former president of ingersoll publications and ray <unk> former senior vice president would head the new in-house management team at goodson which had revenue of $ N million in N 
 the association between the two companies <unk> back <unk> years to a friendship between television producer mark goodson and ingersoll founder ralph ingersoll 
 the latter 's son ralph ingersoll jr. took over the company and has been managing the goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for goodson 
 but in recent years mr. ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm warburg <unk> & co 
 ingersoll has N <unk> and N other <unk> papers in the u.s. and europe 
 the company said its revenue will exceed $ N million this year 
 ingersoll president robert m. <unk> said in a statement that the company is <unk> by the conclusion of the goodson relationship and will be able to concentrate all our <unk> on ingersoll 's own papers 
 mr. goodson in his own statement was less upbeat saying unfortunately over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that ralph and i have different <unk> and that he feels more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the goodson papers 
 just five months after ogilvy group was <unk> up in an unsolicited takeover kenneth roman ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer said he is leaving to take a top post at american express co 
 mr. roman N years old abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency whose largest client is american express to become american express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications 
 he will succeed harry l. freeman N who has said he will retire in december 
 mr. freeman said in august that he would retire by the end of this year to take executive responsibility for an embarrassing effort to <unk> banker <unk> <unk> 
 american express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about mr. <unk> 
 the company later <unk> and agreed to make $ N million in contributions to charities chosen by him 
 although mr. freeman is retiring he will continue to work as a consultant for american express on a project basis 
 ad industry executives were n't surprised by mr. roman 's decision to leave ogilvy 
 the agency under his direction bitterly fought a takeover attempt by wpp group plc of london before <unk> in may 
 and although mr. roman and wpp 's chief executive martin sorrell have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other people close to mr. roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company 
 some executives also cite tension because of efforts by mr. sorrell a financial man to cut costs at the agency 
 mr. roman will be succeeded as the head of ogilvy 's flagship ad agency ogilvy & mather worldwide by graham phillips N who had been president of north american operations and who like mr. sorrell is british 
 alexander <unk> N will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations 
 he had been president of the international operations 
 mr. roman also had <unk> ogilvy group 's two other units the <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising agency and its research division but those units will now report directly to wpp 
 mr. roman appears <unk> for the american express job 
 known as a traditional executive he is very much in the conservative american express <unk> 
 moreover after N years at ogilvy he had <unk> a reputation for being <unk> and a straight arrow which can only help american express in the wake of the <unk> incident 
 he also is close to american express 's chairman and chief executive officer james d. robinson iii 
 aside from working with mr. robinson on the american express advertising account for about N years mr. roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as mr. robinson 
 the abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that mr. roman had been pushed out of ogilvy 's top spot by mr. sorrell 
 but mr. roman <unk> denied the speculation saying mr. sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine the wine naturally was seagram 's brand an ogilvy client 
 he asked me not to resign 
 the implication that i was pushed aside would n't be accurate mr. roman said 
 mr. sorrell traveling in the far east could n't be reached 
 mr. roman said american express 's mr. robinson first approached him about the job in late september 
 according to industry executives peter <unk> a former european community commissioner from ireland was also a serious <unk> for the american express job 
 although it ultimately was n't offered to him he will be on <unk> to american express as an adviser on international matters 
 after talking on and off for the past four weeks mr. roman said he agreed to take the job because it 's the right time it 's a <unk> opportunity and i think i leave the company in very strong hands 
 it was my decision not anyone else 's 
 mr. roman also brushed aside reports about <unk> between him and mr. phillips his successor at ogilvy 
 the two executives could hardly be more different 
 mr. roman comes across as a <unk> executive mr. phillips has a <unk> <unk> 
 during time off mr. roman tends to his garden mr. phillips <unk> to a <unk> for among other things fast cars and planes 
 industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently the wpp takeover brought them closer together 
 i 'm the guy who made him head of new york head of the u.s. president of north america and recommended him to mr. sorrell as my successor 
 would i have done all those things <unk> if i did n't think he was the right guy mr. roman asked 
 he labeled reports of <unk> ridiculous and said that he spent part of the weekend on mr. phillips 's boat in connecticut 
 mr. roman will oversee american express 's public relations and government affairs among other things but he wo n't be involved in its advertising which is handled by the operating units 
 i consider this a second career he said 
 he also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee made up of the top corporate and operating executives 
 mr. roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous <unk> at ogilvy 
 american express kraft general foods and mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency 
 general foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work and will continue to be said david <unk> a vice president of kraft general foods 
 but some clients and analysts expressed concern that mr. phillips is n't as well-known to many clients 
 ken was my key contact said j. nicholas hahn president and chief executive officer of cotton inc. which represents cotton producers 
 i do n't know mr. phillips all that well 
 i have n't seen or talked to him in several years 
 and some analysts questioned whether mr. phillips would have the skills ogilvy needs to turn the agency around 
 while the agency has done well in many parts of the world its flagship new york office has had a dismal track record recently it has won few new accounts while losing big ones including maxwell house 
 i think mr. phillips is going to need some help 
 i think they need creative leadership and i do n't think they have it said <unk> hill an analyst with wertheim & co 
 ogilvy & mather 's top creative executive norman berry left the agency earlier this year 
 <unk> berry was a creative <unk> at the company and nobody has filled that <unk> said ms. hill 
 but other analysts said that having mr. phillips succeed mr. roman would make for a smooth transition 
 graham phillips has been there a long time knows the culture well is aggressive and apparently gets along well with mr. sorrell said andrew <unk> an analyst with drexel burnham lambert 
 it 's probably a reasonable transition 
 hopefully he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in new york

 the unit 's first two offerings are slated to be the secret life of ian fleming a <unk> about the former british spy who wrote the james bond novels and <unk> island produced by <unk> <unk> who also stars in the movie 
 ted turner turner broadcasting 's chairman was named chairman of turner pictures and <unk> <unk> president of turner entertainment networks was named president of the unit 
 in an interview mr. <unk> said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for <unk> and to distribute them internationally 
 but he said turner broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the u.s. 
 when that occurs and when the time is right we 'll release the films in the u.s. he said adding that turner pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in N 
 turner has made several movies <unk> and <unk> for its networks in recent years but the company has never acted as a <unk> movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters 
 mr. <unk> said the secret life of ian fleming and <unk> island cost more than $ N million each to make which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release 
 the turner move is in line with a cable-tv trend toward more original programming and toward finding more ways to <unk> the high cost of producing films 
 in july viacom inc. formed viacom pictures to produce N <unk> movies a year that will premiere on showtime network and be distributed later in various markets including foreign theaters

 that complex bid was billed as france 's largest takeover ever this one is slightly smaller 
 moreover suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of societe generale de <unk> 
 paribas officials once considered france 's <unk> bankers felt <unk> at suez 's success and its rapid growth 
 although paribas denies it analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing <unk> between france 's two largest investment banking groups 
 it also reflects the broader pressure on companies in europe to keep up as the european community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by N 
 although paribas chairman <unk> <unk> would n't rule out eventually selling all of navigation mixte 's insurance operations to allianz he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate 
 he also told reporters the acquisition would give paribas fresh diversity bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak 
 navigation mixte has investments in a sugar company a food and <unk> concern a <unk> and bus and trucking firms among others 
 and navigation mixte has a huge hidden attraction 
 payment by allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the french concern 's treasury to an estimated N billion francs 
 paribas said it will bid N francs a share for navigation mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend and N francs for those created july N which are eligible for partial dividends 
 alternatively it said it would offer three paribas shares themselves eligible for dividends as of next jan. N for one navigation mixte share 
 paribas shares closed down N francs at N francs and navigation mixte shares were suspended at N francs pending the outcome of the bid 
 paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it 
 this is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes 
 some financial sources said privately that paribas <unk> in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price 
 mr. <unk> responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake striking an alliance with current management 
 when <unk> <unk> navigation mixte chairman marc fournier rejected paribas 's offer and began buying paribas shares in <unk> mr. <unk> said he felt obliged to bid for control 
 he told reporters he had information that mr. fournier was preparing to buy as much as N N of paribas up from less than N N currently 
 a bid against paribas could n't be ruled out 
 france 's second-largest government-owned insurance company assurances <unk> de france has been building its own navigation mixte stake currently thought to be between N N and N N 
 analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover however and its officials could n't be reached 
 crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said opec oil producers are n't putting the <unk> on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter 
 in trading on the new york mercantile exchange the u.s. benchmark west texas intermediate crude fell N cents a barrel to $ N for december delivery 
 petroleum products prices also declined 
 analysts pointed to reports that the organization of petroleum exporting countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of N million barrels a day with some accounts putting the <unk> group 's output as high as N million barrels a day 
 that level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter when demand is traditionally strong 
 but because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year several market participants say opec production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further 
 the group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early N 
 with prices already headed lower news of a series of explosions at a major phillips petroleum co. chemical facility on the houston ship channel also was bearish for prices 
 even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude analysts say now the facility wo n't need any at a time of already high availability 
 the phillips plant makes polyethylene <unk> and other plastic products 
 a company official said the explosions began when a seal <unk> out 
 dozens of workers were injured authorities said 
 there was no immediate estimate of damage from the company 
 some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices 
 for instance one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ N a barrel 
 our <unk> is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ N he said 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 copper 
 the selling that started on friday continued yesterday 
 the december contract fell N cents a pound to $ N 
 london metal exchange warehouse stocks were down only N metric tons for the week to N tons expectations late last week were a drop of N to N tons 
 the new york market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ <unk> level selling picked up as previous buyers <unk> out of their positions and aggressive short sellers anticipating further declines moved in 
 fund selling also picked up at that point 
 according to bernard savaiko senior commodity analyst at painewebber the only stability to the market came when short sellers <unk> moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts 
 this activity produced small rallies which in turn attracted new short selling 
 mr. savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar which would normally support the u.s. copper market 
 such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong british pound to buy copper in new york 
 the sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong he said 
 copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ N to $ N 
 mr. savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ N 
 precious metals 
 platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments which use both metals showed signs of producing extra heat 
 january platinum closed down $ N an ounce at $ N nearly $ N above its low for the day 
 december palladium was off $ N an ounce at $ N 
 platinum is believed to have good support around $ N and palladium at around $ N 
 some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report which will be released today 
 such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile <unk> <unk> 
 mr. savaiko <unk> that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly <unk> by such stories 
 he said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again 
 also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier the soviet union 
 many analysts believe that the soviets ' <unk> for dollars this year to buy grain and other western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much 
 grains and soybeans 
 prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news 
 on the chicago board of trade soybeans for november delivery closed at $ N a bushel down half a cent while the december wheat contract rose <unk> of a cent to $ N a bushel 
 supporting prices was the announcement late friday of additional grain sales to the soviet union 
 but acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the farm belt 
 strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices 
 sugar 
 world prices tumbled mostly from their own weight according to analysts 
 the march contract ended at N cents a pound down N cent 
 for the past week or so traders have been expecting india to buy between N and N tons of refined sugar and there have been expectations of a major purchase by japan 
 but with no reports of either country actually entering the market analysts said futures prices became vulnerable 
 developing countries such as india some analysts said seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range around N cents and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range around N cents 
 but <unk> <unk> a sugar analyst with <unk> <unk> international ltd. said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler speculators he said got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs 
 a painewebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country 
 cocoa 
 futures rallied modestly 
 the december contract rose $ N a metric ton to $ N near its high for the day 
 <unk> & <unk> ltd. a british <unk> house estimated that the N world cocoa surplus would be N tons down from N tons for the previous year 
 market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns which in the past have <unk> sharp rallies 
 recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s 
 at such prices according to mr. savaiko bargain hunting and <unk> buying back of contracts previously sold by speculators is n't uncommon 
 but mr. savaiko expects <unk> producer selling at around the $ N to $ N level 
 he also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in new york as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move 
 <unk> <unk> research analyst at shearson lehman hutton said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the ivory coast a major cocoa producer 
 rockwell international corp. bought out <unk> corp. 's interest in <unk> a joint venture of the two companies based in tokyo

 the bond market which sometimes <unk> on bad news cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker 
 early in the day bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will <unk> an economy headed for trouble 
 such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the federal reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and <unk> off a recession 
 for example today the department of commerce is scheduled to release the september durable goods report 
 the consensus forecast of N economists surveyed by dow jones capital markets report is for a N N drop in september orders 
 that would follow a N N advance in august 
 bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower

 in the treasury market analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news 
 on the negative side the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market said william m. <unk> economist at daiwa securities america inc

 today the treasury will sell $ N billion of new two-year notes 
 tomorrow resolution funding corp. a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ N billion of 30-year bonds 
 so far money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the refcorp bonds 
 analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction 
 while some say the auction should proceed smoothly others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ N billion of asset-backed securities by ford motor credit corp. may have <unk> some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale 
 the division of auto maker ford motor co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history 
 the company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by first boston corp 
 the issue yields N N and carries a guarantee covering N N of the deal from the company 
 first boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering 
 the issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year treasurys

 the rates were up from last week 's auction when they were N N and N N respectively

 in light of the recent <unk> in the high-yield market junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors 
 in the case of beatrice salomon brothers inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $ N million portion of the offering 
 under the originally contemplated terms of the offering the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above treasurys

 mortgage-backed securities

 the federal national mortgage association offered $ N billion of remic securities in three issues and the federal home loan mortgage corp. offered a $ N million remic backed by N N <unk> securities 
 part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are <unk> mortgage securities being sold by thrifts 
 traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks 
 in the mortgage <unk> sector active issues rose but trailed gains in the treasury market 
 government national mortgage association N N securities for november delivery were quoted late yesterday at N N up N and freddie mac N N securities were at N N up N

 an official with lead underwriter first boston said orders for the san antonio bonds were on the slow side 
 he attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size as well as the general <unk> in the municipal marketplace

 manville having rid itself of asbestos now sells <unk> forest products minerals and industrial goods 
 <unk> stuff it 's not 
 but manville 's ownership is unusual and it has caught the eye of some <unk> and patient investors 
 the <unk> concern which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year is controlled by the manville personal injury settlement trust 
 the trust which owns N N of manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims 
 when and if the trust runs out of cash which seems increasingly likely it will need to convert its manville stock to cash 
 but as an N N owner if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market it would likely depress the price of its shares 
 some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will instead seek to convert the company 's shares to cash in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just <unk> stock on the market 
 their principal asset is manville common stock says jeffrey <unk> who runs <unk> associates an investment fund that owns manville shares 
 if they tried to sell they 'd be chasing their own <unk> 
 what makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares 
 the trust is n't commenting on when it might need to <unk> its manville stock 
 however the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims 
 its cash and liquid securities fell by $ N million in the first six months of N 
 the trust also will receive $ N million a year starting in N on a bond it holds from manville 
 and beginning in N it will have a claim on as much as N N of manville 's annual net income 
 even so the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch 
 as of june N it had settled only about N of the N received claims from asbestos victims for an average of $ N each 
 the average should drop over time since the most expensive claims are being settled first 
 and as of midyear settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ N million more than half the trust 's total of $ N million in cash and <unk> securities 
 at some point we 're going to need an <unk> of funds a person close to the trust says 
 even before then the trust may be eager to unload manville stock 
 it does n't pay a dividend and this trust needs income 
 moreover with N N of its assets tied up in manville the trust is badly in need of diversification 
 obviously a diversified portfolio would have less risk the person close to the trust says 
 manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring 
 though the ink is barely dry on its new <unk> law structure bill bullock manville 's head of investor relations says the company is continually <unk> whether there is a better way to be structured 
 we understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares he says 
 of course one option would be for manville to buy out the trust 's shares which would do little to benefit public stockholders 
 but the trust in most cases is <unk> from seeking a buyer for only its shares before november N 
 and both the trust and manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that in the asbestos era <unk> the manville name 
 thus analysts say the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt manville 's other shareholders 
 this is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders one investor says 
 even if there is no restructuring manville seems to be attractive long-term 
 its stock at N N trades at about N N times estimated N earnings an <unk> low multiple for a company with <unk> customers 
 mr. bullock says N N of revenues are tied to construction 
 analysts predict little or no near-term growth 
 they are nonetheless high on manville 's management 
 it 's one of the best in the business says salomon brothers analyst stephen <unk> 
 and he says manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other <unk> firms are hurting and selling cheap 
 with a conservative <unk> ratio of <unk> and $ N million in cash manville is indeed actively on the <unk> 
 so far as a <unk> <unk> manville has n't bought much 
 paul <unk> an analyst at duff & phelps says even though they have borrowing power they have been disciplined about acquisitions 
 and mr. <unk> says that with N N of its stock in friendly hands manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul

 santa fe pacific corp. is preparing a plan to sell a N N stake in its large real estate unit to a california public employee pension fund for $ N million after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders 
 the plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation santa fe pacific realty corp. of $ N billion 
 santa fe pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today according to people familiar with the transaction 
 if approved the sale is expected to close by year 's end with the spinoff <unk> by the end of N 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday santa fe pacific closed at $ N down N cents 
 santa fe pacific realty is a major california land and building owner whose prime properties include N undeveloped acres in the san francisco bay area and several office sites 
 a spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's northern california earthquake 
 as a result of the partial sale and spinoff the $ N billion california public employees retirement system would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation according to officials of the fund who described the plan 
 a spokesman for chicago-based santa fe pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund 
 also holding two seats each on the board they said would be olympia & york developments ltd. controlled by the <unk> family of canada and itel corp. controlled by chicago businessman sam <unk> 
 the <unk> and mr. <unk> the largest holders of santa fe pacific stock have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments including possible <unk> 
 itel bought a N N stake in <unk> fe pacific last year and olympia & york later purchased about a N N stake they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in <unk> fe pacific 
 the sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of santa fe pacific into <unk> companies for its railroad and energy operations as well as real estate 
 the <unk> parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price 
 at the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze 
 the california pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual 
 pension funds rarely own as much as a N N stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company 
 in addition pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns 
 but fund officials said the santa fe pacific realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with california properties 
 it also marks a major commitment to real estate development which we have n't been involved with before said dale hanson the fund 's executive director 
 under the proposed plan the fund would also lend santa fe pacific realty $ N million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the <unk> market price 
 the note would <unk> interest at the rate of N N a year which would be payable to the fund after five years according to stephen e. <unk> a real estate consultant working for the fund 
 the purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the <unk> company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments mr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> concern clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio he said 
 for the last year santa fe pacific has <unk> its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio 
 real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier the company said 
 in a statement late yesterday santa fe pacific 's chairman robert d. <unk> said that santa fe pacific realty would repay more than $ N million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff 
 that would help reduce santa fe pacific 's remaining debt to about $ N million from a high of $ N billion in early N 
 it was n't clear where santa fe pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ N million which would be well above the $ N million that california pension fund officials say they plan to provide 
 the realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors among other possibilities 
 the santa fe pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect saying the deal was still under negotiation 
 santa fe pacific realty owns N million acres of property including N buildings with more than N million square feet of space 
 it also holds nearly N acres of raw land with development potential but under a previously announced strategy the company has targeted building on N acres in california arizona and the chicago area 
 among those are the N acres in the san francisco bay area including N acres in the mission bay area 
 the california pension fund which has $ N billion already invested in real estate and mortgages could be a valuable funding source for that development although it is n't obliged to make further investments 
 the fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund and it has a growing cash flow now <unk> $ N billion a year 
 fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with santa fe pacific but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers <unk> realty corp. of chicago 
 <unk> officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the santa fe pacific realty board mr. <unk> said to <unk> the fund from potential liability problems 
 gaf part iii is scheduled to begin today 
 after two <unk> the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of gaf corp. and its vice chairman james t. sherwin have changed considerably 
 the first two gaf trials were watched closely on wall street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations 
 in an <unk> indictment the government charged gaf a wayne n.j. chemical maker and mr. sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of union carbide corp. in advance of gaf 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in N 
 the government 's credibility in the gaf case depended heavily on its star witness boyd l. jefferies the former los angeles brokerage chief who was <unk> by former <unk> ivan boesky and then pointed the finger at mr. sherwin takeover <unk> <unk> b. lewis and corporate raider paul <unk> 
 the gaf trials were viewed as <unk> of the government 's strength in its cases against mr. lewis and mr. <unk> 
 mr. jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing 
 but gaf 's bellwether role was short-lived 
 the first gaf trial ended in a <unk> after four weeks when u.s. district judge mary johnson lowe found that a prosecutor improperly but <unk> withheld a document 
 after N hours of <unk> the jurors in the second trial said they were <unk> <unk> and another <unk> was declared on march N 
 meanwhile a federal jury found mr. <unk> guilty on securities fraud and other charges in june 
 a month later mr. jefferies was <unk> a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government 
 in august mr. lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts 
 nevertheless the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the gaf case 
 the <unk> have left the <unk> of gaf mr. sherwin and gaf chairman samuel <unk> in limbo 
 for mr. sherwin a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ N fine on each count 
 gaf faces potential fines of $ N for each count 
 individuals familiar with the case said that throughout september defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial but by the end of the month the talks had ended 
 there is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of gaf 's attorney arthur <unk> and mr. sherwin 's counsel stephen <unk> will include testimony by mr. sherwin or mr. <unk> 
 neither testified at the previous trials 
 for now defense attorneys are <unk> about their plans 
 max <unk> another gaf defense attorney said yesterday as we go in for the third time <unk> <unk> 's famous line is apt it 's <unk> <unk> all over again 
 dalkon shield claimants hope to stop <unk> appeal 
 attorneys for more than N women who claim injuries from the dalkon shield contraceptive device have asked the u.s. supreme court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for <unk> robins co. which manufactured the device 
 the dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other 
 baltimore attorney michael a. <unk> and N other attorneys representing N claimants in the u.s. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay and perhaps even destroy a $ N billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan 
 the bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the supreme court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims 
 it also bars future suits against robins company officials members of the robins family and robins 's former insurer aetna life & casualty co 
 the latter provision is legally unprecedented said alan b. morrison a public interest lawyer in washington d.c. who is challenging the plan on behalf of N claimants 
 more than N claims against robins are pending 
 the company made and marketed the dalkon shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries 
 robins has been in proceedings under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code since august N such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts 
 american home products corp. wants to acquire robins but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted 
 in a brief filed with the supreme court last week mr. <unk> <unk> the appeal for raising <unk> and theoretical legal issues while <unk> the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants 
 the supreme court is scheduled to consider the case nov. N and may issue a decision as early as nov. N 
 jury 's criminal conviction under superfund law is a first 
 charles a. <unk> sole <unk> of a louisville ky. <unk> company was found guilty of violating the superfund law as well as the clean air act 
 criminal convictions under the federal superfund law are rare and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case 
 under superfund those who owned generated or <unk> hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time 
 environmental lawyers say virtually all of the superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past <unk> activities 
 but superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic <unk> into the environment 
 in N congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony 
 mr. <unk> was convicted in louisville late last month of violating superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was <unk> 
 he was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building a violation of the clean air act 
 the government sought a criminal penalty because no cleanup is possible here 
 once asbestos is released into the environment it can <unk> anywhere says richard a. dennis the assistant u.s. attorney who prosecuted the case 
 mr. <unk> is scheduled to be sentenced dec. N 
 his lawyer could not be reached for comment 
 mr. <unk> faces as much as three years in prison and a $ N fine for the superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ N fine for the violation of the clean air act 
 ted <unk> lawyers switch to victims ' side in <unk> case 
 <unk> cutler & <unk> the washington d.c. law firm that spent over $ N million fighting the execution of <unk> ted <unk> who eventually was executed has taken on another death penalty case before the supreme court this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in arkansas 
 the law firm has filed a <unk> brief jointly with the washington legal foundation a conservative legal group 
 the key issue in the case which the law firm is handling without a fee or pro bono is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review 
 the <unk> ronald gene simmons was convicted of killing N people 
 another <unk> on death row has appealed mr. simmons 's death sentence in a next friend capacity 
 <unk> cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the <unk> who filed the appeal lacks proper standing 
 <unk> mode <unk> cutler 's managing partner says the trial team that represented mr. <unk> was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised 
 the <unk> of the law firm and the washington legal foundation is odd also because <unk> cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for <unk> a liberal bias in its pro bono work 
 we give them a lot of credit for taking this case says <unk> 's alan <unk>

 henry <unk> the assistant u.s. attorney handling the case said about N customers were <unk> and that <unk> 's total proceeds from the sales were $ N million 
 attorneys for messrs. burke and evans and ms. <unk> said that although their clients admitted to making some <unk> in the sales they had believed that the works were authorized by mr. <unk> who died in january

 <unk> said mr. decker 's posts were assumed by david <unk> <unk> 's chairman who at N years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country 
 mr. decker is about N years old 
 neither mr. <unk> nor mr. decker could be reached to comment 
 <unk> has about $ N billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern california 
 it controls about N N of the affluent <unk> county market across the golden gate bridge from san francisco 
 mr. decker 's resignation surprised many industry officials 
 he was brought to the company in september N after N years at los angeles-based first interstate bancorp 
 the bank had been suffering in late N from a slew of bad real estate loans made in arizona 
 when he was hired mr. <unk> <unk> mr. decker 's extraordinary skills and his outstanding reputation as one of the west 's <unk> bankers 
 though the bank is n't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative california market its condition has improved since mr. decker took over 
 for the six months ended june N it earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with net income of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 its stock also has risen lately at least partly because it is considered a possible takeover candidate

 it said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses 
 it also can sell the right to regain the subsidiary to another party 
 also the broker-dealer subsidiary integrated resources equity corp. was renamed royal alliance associates inc 
 because of integrated 's widely reported troubles the unit 's representatives had been <unk> a name change 
 royal alliance to which the N representatives ' licenses will be transferred is a shell company integrated owns

 integrated will pump $ N million to $ N million into royal alliance as initial funding 
 in an interview mr. <unk> said that based on criteria yet to be determined he expects to distribute N N of royal alliance to the representatives who sell integrated 's insurance and mutual-fund products 
 if integrated <unk> royal alliance the representatives will retain their N N ownership 
 mr. <unk> indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime 
 the subsidiary is n't expected to be profitable for at least one year 
 if integrated <unk> the unit it would receive any profit the unit reports even while the unit is independent

 the canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the u.s. dollar since late august prompting the bank of canada to sell the canadian currency on the market 
 traders say that after a week of nervously tracking every development on wall street the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new u.s. economic data

 the market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross national product due out thursday which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace 
 the consensus view on real gnp the total value of the u.s. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation calls for a N N gain on an annual basis slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's N N but still fairly strong 
 few market participants expect the u.s. unit to rally sharply on the news if it turns out as expected

 the justice department has revised certain internal guidelines and <unk> others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants 
 the most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid <unk> the normal business functions of companies charged under the racketeering law a senior department official said 
 another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties in a case brought under the racketeering law the official david runkel said 
 the department distributed the revisions and <unk> to u.s. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of <unk> prosecutorial guidelines mr. runkel said 
 the changes apply to prosecutions brought under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law

 the rico law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers

 that means that if the <unk> deals with one part of the business you do n't attempt to seize the whole business you attempt to seize assets related to the crime he explained 
 in general the thrust of the department 's <unk> is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less <unk> means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction mr. runkel said 
 it was the kind of <unk> rarely seen within the congress let alone within the same party 
 sen. alan cranston <unk> over to the house side of capitol hill a few days ago and <unk> his testimony to fellow democrat rep. henry gonzalez 
 it was offered as an expression of cooperation to mr. gonzalez who is investigating the $ N billion failure of lincoln savings & loan association 
 but instead of thanks sen. cranston was treated with cool <unk> 
 every witness receives a formal subpoena rep. gonzalez told him 
 seldom have house hearings caused so much <unk> in the senate where california sen. cranston and four other senators were already <unk> in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged <unk> of lincoln by their friend and political <unk> charles keating jr. principal <unk> of lincoln 's parent company american continental corp. of phoenix <unk> 
 at the first day of the house banking committee 's hearings last week william seidman chairman of the resolution trust corp. the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts said the agency is investigating whether lincoln made illegal political contributions 
 mr. keating arranged nearly $ N million in donations to sen. cranston and his various political causes and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers 
 future witnesses include a former federal s&l regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to <unk> the regulatory process by <unk> on behalf of mr. keating 
 unlike many lawmakers chairman gonzalez says he considers <unk> with regulators to be improper 
 when you reach a point where a <unk> body is trying to shape administrative decisions then that 's a <unk> in my book the texas <unk> says 
 and he has attached himself to the lincoln story <unk> 
 unless the questions are answered i will keep on going 
 lawmakers often are reluctant to <unk> colleagues even those of opposing political parties 
 in the recent housing and urban development department scandal for example rep. thomas <unk> the california democrat who led the hearings <unk> through embarrassing disclosures about hud grants secured by sen. <unk> <unk> a new york republican 
 but chairman gonzalez is a genuine <unk> 
 he comes from the same political line as wright <unk> a <unk> texas <unk> who <unk> the banking committee until N 
 mr. gonzalez is also a <unk> for ethical standards who refuses to accept <unk> and who believes in conducting official business in the open 
 early in his political career as a city <unk> in san antonio he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced <unk> the <unk> affair publicly as a <unk> meeting 
 the immediate target of rep. gonzalez 's inquiry is danny wall chairman of the office of thrift supervision 
 as the principal regulator of the thrift industry mr. wall delayed <unk> lincoln s&l for more than two years after his staff told him that the california thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly 
 rep. gonzalez seems <unk> to <unk> out at mr. wall when hearings resume thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from san francisco william black and mike <unk> 
 mr. wall relieved them of responsibility for <unk> lincoln in N 
 mr. gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to washington by mr. wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance 
 i think he is trying to improperly influence a witness and by god i 'm not going to <unk> it he says 
 mr. wall however is a <unk> child of the senate and former staff director of its banking committee 
 an inquiry into his handling of lincoln s&l inevitably will drag in sen. cranston and the four others sens. dennis <unk> d. ariz. john <unk> r. ariz. john glenn d. ohio and donald <unk> d. mich 
 they all attended a meeting in april N questioning why a federal audit of lincoln s&l had dragged on for two years 
 i 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names of the senators will be brought out mr. gonzalez says 
 this is raising <unk> 
 when i first got a <unk> at the witness list i could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this says michael <unk> director of congress watch a consumer group 
 there are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators 
 and a democratic aide to a banking committee member remarks i too am <unk> by it because gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of democratic senators in a very bad position 
 all the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a <unk> 
 mr. keating lives in phoenix and the california thrift 's parent is an <unk> corporation with holdings in michigan 
 chairman gonzalez <unk> <unk> for sen. <unk> his counterpart as chairman of the senate banking committee 
 he 's <unk> he 's good and i know he 's an honest man the <unk> says 
 but at the same time mr. gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over mr. wall during house-senate negotiations over s&l bailout legislation during the summer 
 the senate negotiators included sens. cranston and <unk> and mr. wall 's principal sponsor republican sen. <unk> <unk> of utah 
 they were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve mr. wall 's job and to avoid a <unk> hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about lincoln s&l 
 most <unk> the senate traded away the bush administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout which was partly <unk> later 
 at the time mr. gonzalez said several senators told him that they could get some <unk> out of the way if there could be some understanding on <unk> 's insistence on wall 
 now mr. gonzalez is holding the equivalent of <unk> hearings anyway under the <unk> of the lincoln investigation 
 in a way that 's what this is mr. gonzalez concedes 
 even some house banking committee members could suffer from the fallout 
 mr. keating raised $ N for rep. doug <unk> 's N re-election campaign while the georgia democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit <unk> 
 he recently voted present when the committee authorized a subpoena to <unk> mr. keating to testify then changed his vote to yes

 rep. jim <unk> r. iowa says the lincoln s&l affair is the biggest bank <unk> in history and adds the great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional <unk> in the making 
 a witness set to testify on thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying lincoln <unk> campaign contributions illegally 
 but the witness william <unk> california 's chief state thrift regulator denies saying that 
 i do n't know whether it was done properly or not because i 'm not a lawyer he said in a telephone interview yesterday 
 but he said he is prepared to testify that executives of lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls <unk> them to make specific contributions 
 the committee also has summoned mr. wall 's predecessor edwin gray 
 he has characterized the five senators ' roles as <unk> to an attempt to <unk> the regulatory process and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a N meeting 
 so the senators must <unk> themselves

 ms. volokh quit her job to remove herself from the public eye 
 the wait was <unk> 
 before granting ms. volokh 's parents a visa the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband whom she had <unk> N years earlier 
 mr. volokh was fired from his job and had to endure hours of organized <unk> abuse from his <unk> accusations of sabotage and <unk> activities

 william d. <unk> president of the <unk> trade and economic council has a warning for u.s. companies trying to do business in the soviet union 
 it 's an extremely complex market and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment mr. <unk> says 
 we are not trying to encourage everyone 
 <unk> by such words of caution corporate america is <unk> to moscow <unk> by a huge <unk> market and mikhail gorbachev 's attempt to overhaul the soviet economy 
 doing business with the russians once the pursuit of a handful of <unk> veterans has become the goal of such major companies as general motors corp. federal express corp. and procter & gamble co. as well as a <unk> of smaller firms 
 reflecting the <unk> interest more than N u.s. companies are taking part in a moscow exhibition organized by mr. <unk> 's trade group 
 but while u.s. interest may be big and growing the difficulties that have <unk> deals in the past show no sign of <unk> 
 alongside the old problems of a <unk> currency and an <unk> bureaucracy western business executives must now <unk> with new <unk> linked to perestroika the restructuring of the soviet economy 
 executives say mr. gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities 
 changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of <unk> soviet players many who promise more than they can deliver 
 and some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles their ventures now have to be endorsed by such <unk> bodies as the soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics 
 you have to go out to all your constituents says james h. <unk> who is <unk> the most ambitious attempt by u.s. firms to break into the soviet market involving investment of more than $ N billion in some two dozen joint ventures 
 as part of that attempt by the american trade consortium mr. <unk> says he spends a lot of time lobbying 
 growing public fears about the soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans 
 over the past two years soviet ministries have been talking to international firms including occidental petroleum co. and combustion engineering inc. of the u.s. montedison <unk> of italy and several japanese groups about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants 
 the plans have come under fire from soviet environmentalists and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped 
 whatever the difficulties mr. gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade 
 for political as well as economic reasons u.s. companies are at the top of his priorities a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the u.s. trade show last week 
 talking to a small group of u.s. executives <unk> mr. gorbachev appeared <unk> for a big expansion in u.s.-soviet trade which now amounts to a <unk> $ N billion annually 
 the u.s. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures behind west germany finland and italy 
 according to several people present at the meeting mr. gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the u.s. possibly at his next summit meeting with president bush 
 judging by the crush at the exhibition deprived soviet consumers are more than ready for u.s. products 
 hundreds of people lined up every day at the colgate-palmolive co. stand to receive a free tube of <unk> a commodity in <unk> short supply here

 both colgate and procter & gamble have received big orders for <unk> soap and <unk> 
 the american trade consortium says it is planning to ship some $ N million of consumer goods financed by bank credits in the first few months of next year 
 but the current soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair 
 the goal of most u.s. firms joint ventures remains <unk> 
 because the soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars marks and other western currencies companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find soviet goods they can take in a <unk> transaction 
 international competition for the few soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up however

 several medical concerns including pfizer inc. hewlett-packard co. colgate and <unk> laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach 
 it 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries says dennis a. <unk> president of medical service partners inc. who is putting the medical consortium together 
 some u.s. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale 
 one group seeks to publish a u.s.-soviet medical journal in <unk> with the u.s.s.r. ministry of health 
 according to richard p. mills a <unk> official of the u.s. partner N copies of the quarterly will be printed in russian from next year 
 it will be financed by advertisements from u.s. companies and by simultaneous publication of an <unk> journal containing details of soviet medical <unk>

 since then the bank has strengthened its italian network and has posted strong results 
 the shareholders felt we needed a foreign presence more than we needed links with an insurance company an ambrosiano spokeswoman said

 mr. skase also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of qintex australia with qintex ltd. which owns N N of qintex australia 
 he said the move will significantly reduce administrative and operating costs but he did n't provide details of the merger 
 company officials said over the weekend that qintex australia 's bank creditors have become concerned about a <unk> of bad news at the company including a failed us$ N billion plan to buy mgm\/ua communications co. a beverly hills calif. movie and television production concern 
 friday qintex entertainment inc. a <unk> u.s. affiliate filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in qintex australia and force it to sell assets 
 the company 's latest moves were disclosed after the australian stock exchange suspended trading in shares of qintex australia and qintex ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans investments and deposits at qintex entertainment 
 mr. skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry 
 it said qintex entertainment owes qintex australia us$ N million in loans not secured by specific assets 
 qintex australia also said it has an investment of a$ N million in qintex entertainment shares 
 in the statement mr. skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in australia the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about a$ N million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities 
 in march qintex sold N N of the three mirage resorts to japan 's nippon <unk> co. and mitsui & co. for a$ N million 
 yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the japanese companies will acquire qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts

 chip 's memory is here today here tomorrow 
 two companies plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off 
 today 's most widely used <unk> chips have volatile memories their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity so they need external power supplies 
 national semiconductor corp. and a start-up named <unk> corp. plan to start shipping so-called <unk> memories which can remember data for at least N years without any current flowing to them 
 the chips use materials such as lead <unk> <unk> to form <unk> switches that retain their data without electricity 
 developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined 
 but <unk> of colorado springs colo. plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple <unk> chips in december 
 the company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment including <unk> and hard-disk drives 
 national semiconductor is getting <unk> technology from <unk> corp. in <unk> <unk> 
 national says it agreed to acquire <unk> 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips including a <unk> memory next year 
 once production hurdles are overcome the chips could take over a significant part of the market 
 in addition to not <unk> an outside power source they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips 
 military buyers have shown interest national says because <unk> chips resist <unk> radiation 
 and while today 's <unk> chips such as electronically <unk> <unk> <unk> memory chips ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they learn data slowly <unk> chips accept data at very high speeds 
 showing up in court without being there 
 an austin texas company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town

 that could change thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics 
 video <unk> corp. which markets <unk> systems is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow <unk> by live television 
 the company installed a prototype system that <unk> dallas with miami over digital phone lines 
 and it is preparing to set up shop in chicago new york and N other cities where <unk> agencies can tie conference rooms into the network

 japanese reverse <unk> on patent protection 
 japan 's <unk> of u.s. patents has been a <unk> point for american chip makers 
 now at least one japanese company is turning the courtroom tables 
 until now most japanese charges have been responses to suits against them 
 but last year hitachi ltd. surprised japan 's electronics industry when it accused korea 's <unk> electronics co. of using hitachi technology to make dynamic <unk> memory chips 
 a settlement was reached but was n't made public 
 and hitachi went on the offensive against the u.s. 's motorola inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that motorola 's new <unk> chip <unk> on a hitachi patent 
 another recent hitachi suit <unk> motorola of reverse engineering a hitachi technology a <unk> from a nation of champion reverse engineers 
 the moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say japan is starting to take 
 hitachi made the <unk> charges in an amendment to a <unk> filed in a federal district court in texas after motorola sued hitachi for patent violation 
 hitachi charges motorola has engaged in fraudulent and <unk> conduct in the procurement of certain motorola patents used in motorola 's <unk> microprocessor chip 
 translation motorola appears to have taken a hitachi technology that is <unk> in the u.s. hitachi says and tried to make it look like a new technology 
 motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges

 tandy corp. citing sluggish sales of <unk> goods said net income dropped N N for the first quarter ended sept. N 
 the results which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of <unk> earnings for the big electronics retailer disappointed analysts and traders 
 tandy 's stock fell $ N a share to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 net for the quarter was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively <unk> its shares thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income 
 tandy had N million shares outstanding at sept. N down from N million a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 tandy said consumer electronics sales at its radio shack stores have been slow partly because of a lack of hot new products 
 radio shack continues to be lackluster said dennis <unk> analyst with <unk> <unk> & turner in dallas 
 he said tandy has done a decent job increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its grid systems corp. subsidiary which sells computers to bigger businesses but it 's not enough to offset the problems at radio shack 
 sales at radio shack stores open more than a year grew only N N in the quarter from a year earlier he said 
 as a result mr. <unk> said he cut his fiscal N per-share earnings estimate for tandy to $ N from $ N 
 tandy earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year ended june N 
 barry bryant an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. said tandy also has suffered from <unk> sales of its computers aimed at the home and <unk> market which are <unk> and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market 
 tandy has added several new products to that line including a laptop computer priced around $ N and is focusing its advertising on the <unk> software that is packaged with its machines 
 mr. bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help tandy 's results improve in the important christmas quarter 
 they 've been promising N N to N N growth based on the strategic moves they 've made he said 
 if the earnings acceleration is to take place that should be the quarter 
 at a private dinner thursday drexel burnham lambert inc. chief executive frederick joseph delivered a <unk> message about the junk bond market to officials of prudential insurance co. of america 
 mr. joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray according to people familiar with the discussion 
 he said drexel the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because drexel <unk> losing its highly lucrative junk franchise 
 the dinner was a stark confirmation that N is the worst year ever for the $ N billion junk market 
 and investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve 
 amid the market <unk> even drexel which has the <unk> and most loyal following of junk bond investors is pulling in its <unk> 
 although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults withdrawn new offerings redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of <unk> investors 
 for many money managers the past four months have been <unk> 
 this is the worst <unk> ever in the junk market and it could take years before it 's over says mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. a credit rating company 
 in the third quarter for example junk bonds those with less than an investment-grade rating showed negative returns the only major sector of the bond market to do so 
 since the end of last year junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds including <unk> treasury securities 
 the junk market which <unk> to $ N billion from less than $ N billion at the start of the decade has been declining for months as issuers have <unk> under the weight of hefty interest payments 
 the fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with more than $ N billion in junk financing 
 campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale 
 at that point the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell 
 in an interview mr. joseph says his dinner discussion with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk 
 what i thought i was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and <unk> enough quite <unk> which is not at all bad he says 
 nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable <unk> of the market 
 what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden <unk> that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds 
 unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs 
 at closely held <unk> securities corp. junk bond money managers <unk> k. <unk> and <unk> h. <unk> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary <unk> 
 in recent months they say there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them 
 wall street securities firms the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses <unk> said in a recent grim report to customers 
 mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced <unk> redemptions by shareholders <unk> said 
 investors trying to raise cash have sold large liquid issues such as rjr holdings corp. and <unk> co. declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's <unk> 
 and <unk> said buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation 
 in fact savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter <unk> said 
 ms. <unk> and ms. <unk> say they are managing their junk portfolios <unk> building cash and <unk> upgrading the overall quality 
 meanwhile prudential the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ N billion from $ N billion since august because of falling junk prices 
 we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it 's something to be concerned about says james a. <unk> a managing director 
 i have no reason to think things will get worse but this market has a <unk> for surprising us 
 this market teaches us to be <unk> 
 the junk market 's yield <unk> are learning a real painful lesson he says 
 although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble says stuart <unk> manager of aetna life & casualty insurance co. 's $ N billion investment-grade public bond portfolio 
 but we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse 
 and the risks are n't appropriate for us he says 
 the big insurer unlike prudential owns only about $ N million of publicly sold junk bonds 
 the string of big junk bond defaults which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year probably will <unk> some analysts say 
 if anything we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined says paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management 
 mr. <unk> whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on wall street when it was disclosed last april says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high <unk> with his own findings 
 his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of N N 
 one indication of a growing number of junk defaults mr. <unk> says is that about half of the $ N billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by s&p this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of N through N 
 these bonds now rated <unk> include junk offerings by <unk> industries columbia savings colorado first texas savings association <unk> financial corp. integrated resources inc. metropolitan broadcasting corp. resorts international inc. southmark corp. and <unk> inc 
 obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky says bradford cornell professor of finance at university of california 's anderson graduate school of management in los angeles 
 mr. cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds 
 mr. cornell says the junk market is no <unk> as drexel claimed but it also is n't a disaster as the <unk> say 
 despite the junk market 's problems drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its wall street rivals have n't found 
 during the past three weeks for example drexel has sold $ N billion of new junk bonds for turner broadcasting co. uniroyal chemical continental air and duff & phelps 
 still the list of troubled drexel bond offerings <unk> that of any firm on wall street as does its successful offerings 
 troubled <unk> issues include resorts international <unk> integrated resources sci tv gillette holdings western electric and southmark 
 quality junk bonds will continue to trade well says michael <unk> chairman of salomon brothers asset management inc 
 but the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste

 like which are <unk> and which are not 
 with the fall social season well under way <unk> are out in force trying to <unk> their <unk> and sometimes put down their <unk> 
 but the truth is that almost everyone from real-estate agents to city <unk> <unk> and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the <unk> who did the <unk> kids 
 in case you have forgotten his name was rudolph <unk> 
 name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and <unk> says herbert <unk> a new york <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 it can be an avenue of <unk> to a certain sector of society 
 it provides some people a needed sense of <unk> and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know 
 like the long island <unk> in the theater district the other day who <unk> to a <unk> that she once met <unk> <unk> 
 i was having a drink in <unk> 's when all of a sudden i saw a woman 's <unk> coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing <unk> <unk> 
 i knew it was someone important so i followed her into the <unk> room and sure enough it was <unk> 
 so i said <unk> 
 and she said <unk> 
 can you imagine 
 <unk> said <unk> to me 
 some people must drop names call it an <unk> <unk> 
 they ca n't help talking about the big important people they know even if they do n't really know them says dr. <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> a new york writer who changed his name from william stretch in N is an <unk> <unk> 
 i do it <unk> and <unk> and while it may occasionally get me into trouble it 's also gotten me access to parties and society he says 
 name-dropping recently helped mr. <unk> crash a party fame magazine threw for N of the N people mentioned in the <unk> of the late andy <unk> 
 i guess i might have asked <unk> to leave but he drops so many good names we decided to let him stay says steven greenberg publisher of fame 
 after all <unk> was the ultimate <unk> dropping five a day in his <unk> 
 and <unk> was mentioned twice although very briefly and in passing 
 mr. <unk> says that at the party he <unk> to malcolm <unk> publisher of <unk> magazine <unk> been in the columns together mary boone a new york art dealer i think she knows me but i 'm not sure and <unk> <unk> the actress she knows me but we 're not really the best of friends 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> columnist says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party 
 these <unk> do n't <unk> only their <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> mosbacher 
 they even drop <unk> names like <unk> <unk> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says mr. <unk> 
 it 's the <unk> of name-dropping that counts 
 but name-dropping has other benefits often civic 
 in the name of civic pride and from the desire to <unk> a negative image some city <unk> seek to link their <unk> with the most <unk> names the city has to offer 
 take cleveland 
 it has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily <unk> <unk> river caught fire because former mayor ralph <unk> set his hair on fire with an <unk> <unk> and because its proposed rock <unk> roll hall of fame was recently refused an <unk> grant 
 some people call it the mistake on the lake lake <unk> that is 
 it helps to point out how many important people came through cleveland on their way to the top says george miller executive director of the new cleveland campaign a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths 
 mr. miller notes that actor paul <unk> 's family owned a <unk> store in cleveland that the late actress margaret hamilton who played the bad <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> once ran a <unk> school in cleveland and that <unk> bob hope 's father a <unk> once worked on a church next to <unk> hall cleveland 's main concert hall

 mr. <unk> says that a <unk> property <unk> the san fernando valley is priced at $ N million because the late actor <unk> <unk> once lived there

 americans now can choose among N different models of cars vans and trucks up from just N when the decade began according to automotive news a trade publication 
 for car marketers it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from <unk> to one of the new makes on the block 
 for american car buyers the proliferation of choice is both <unk> and confusing 
 malcolm <unk> vice chairman of the jordan <unk> case & taylor advertising agency in new york calls the proliferation <unk> mania 
 he says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a <unk> image 
 the winners he predicts will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value 
 he says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image 
 he <unk> toyota and nissan motor co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models rather than simply adding more <unk> to their standard car lines 
 some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the <unk> 
 there 's more noise out there and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it says vincent p. <unk> executive director of market research and planning at general motors corp

 just four years ago gm planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments

 the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey found that N N of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands 
 for the survey peter d. hart research associates and the roper organization each asked about N u.s. consumers about their buying habits 
 which cars do americans favor most these days 
 it 's hard to <unk> but age seems to be the best <unk> 
 adults under age N like sports cars luxury cars <unk> and imports far more than their elders do 
 three of every N buyers under N would prefer to buy a sports car compared with just N N of adults N and over according to the journal survey 
 young consumers prefer luxury cars by a N N to N N margin even though older buyers because of their incomes are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car 
 perhaps most striking N N of households headed by people aged N to N have at least one foreign car

 program trading amounted to N N of average daily volume in june 
 the big board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of N or more stocks 
 the most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits 
 it 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market 
 salomon brothers inc. was the top program trader in september but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage 
 overall salomon reported program trading volume of N million shares

 a group of shareholders filed suit against imperial corp. of america drexel burnham lambert inc. first executive corp. and others charging them with artificially <unk> imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors 
 the complaint filed in federal district court <unk> imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data 
 it also charges that imperial the holding company for imperial savings & loan experienced major losses and <unk> because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages 
 the suit seeks unspecified damages 
 imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities 
 the derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year 
 imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems 
 although an imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit 
 spokesmen at drexel and first executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit 
 in a separate complaint also filed in federal court here shareholder max <unk> of new york charged imperial its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and <unk> the company 's assets 
 imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either

 eastman kodak co. seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market unveiled a <unk> that can transform conventional <unk> film into high-definition video 
 the move also helps the rochester n.y. photographic giant ensure that its <unk> film business for which it holds a <unk> monopoly supplying every hollywood movie company is n't made <unk> by the <unk> hdtv business 
 while the prototype <unk> is costly it 's being <unk> by the <unk> hdtv industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium 
 the industry has been waiting with <unk> breath for the machines to come along says david <unk> president of <unk> <unk> five productions inc. a new york pioneer in high-definition programming 
 he notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their tv sets with <unk> 
 japanese electronic giants such as sony corp. and hitachi ltd. have focused almost entirely on hdtv hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition 
 and only a handful of small u.s. companies are engaged in high-definition software development 
 it 's estimated that just about N hours of <unk> programming is currently available for airing 
 kodak says its new <unk> hdtv <unk> will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in <unk> <unk> film into high-definition video 
 consumers will be able to switch on their hdtv sets and get all the <unk> benefits the high-tech medium offers 
 otherwise they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tvs 
 it would be like watching a black and white movie on a color tv set says malcolm g. <unk> chairman of the film and video department at the rochester institute of technology 
 the new <unk> are a critical link between film and the television <unk> says <unk> d. <unk> vice president and general manager of kodak 's motion picture and <unk> products division 
 kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its <unk> will be on the market but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years 
 a similar machine already on the market made by rank <unk> ltd. a unit of rank <unk> costs about $ N 
 and the potential market is tremendous industry experts say 
 if hdtv takes off in the u.s. there will be demand for some N to N hdtv <unk> known in the industry as <unk> 
 demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations 
 the <unk> is head and <unk> above anything else i 've seen says richard j. <unk> vice president engineering and development at mca inc. 's universal city studios 
 and mr. <unk> the program producer contends that kodak 's move is a sound marketing decision 
 they ca n't afford to stay out of hdtv 
 indeed the stakes are high 
 the u.s. electronics industry estimates that the hdtv market will total about $ N billion over the next two decades with an additional $ N billion expected to go for related products 
 <unk> break down images into more than N lines compared with N for today 's <unk> providing considerably sharper detail 
 and the sets are wider <unk> the <unk> of a movie screen 
 but the financial rewards are n't expected soon nor are they guaranteed 
 experts estimate the first sets of <unk> wo n't be available for another five to N years and will probably retail for more than $ N each in today 's dollars 
 some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price 
 nevertheless kodak could n't risk letting hdtv turn its <unk> film business into a <unk> 
 kodak understands hdtv is where everybody is going says <unk> 's mr. <unk> 
 yet another political scandal is <unk> japan 
 but this time it 's hurting opposition as well as <unk> members 
 and as it <unk> it 's <unk> some of the more <unk> and <unk> aspects of japanese society 
 already ruling liberal democratic party demands that opposition members testify under <unk> in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month 
 but the scandal itself is so <unk> that <unk> members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of <unk> the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone 
 the opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the ldp is that kind of <unk> says <unk> <unk> former aide to ldp <unk> <unk> <unk> and now an independent analyst 
 but he adds we ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it 
 this time the scandal centers on donations made by the <unk> pachinko <unk> industry 
 pachinko a kind of <unk> is japan 's favorite form of legal gambling 
 the donations so far appear to be small especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the recruit co <unk> scandal that plagued the ruling party last year 
 but the implications could be great 
 pachinko is slightly on the <unk> side often linked to the lower ranks of japan 's <unk> and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax <unk> 
 recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe 
 also about N N of pachinko <unk> owners are korean many of whom maintain close ties with north or south korean residents ' organizations and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in japan 
 to many japanese pachinko is benign or <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> pachinko <unk> <unk> from the main streets and narrow <unk> of cities and towns across the country 
 <unk> pass hours watching the lights <unk> and listening to the metal balls <unk> as much to gamble as to get a little time to be <unk> alone with their thoughts 
 at N yen $ N for a handful of balls pachinko is a common <unk> and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after world war ii 
 but the total of all those <unk> balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of N trillion yen almost $ N billion or nearly the size of japan 's <unk> automobile industry 
 and because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion some observers estimate the real income could be as much as N trillion yen 
 if that money were being taxed it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen 
 in N an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions 
 then in N a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was <unk> in parliament 
 the proposal split the industry in two along the lines of national <unk> north koreans oppose the plan while south koreans japanese and taiwanese accept it or are neutral 
 in august a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to japan socialist party members 
 the magazine alleged that in making the donations the pachinko industry may have been offering <unk> to win support in the battle against prepaid cards or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <unk> and the north korean residents ' organization the chosen <unk> 
 the chosen <unk> and the <unk> immediately denied the report 
 and at first neither the opposition nor the ldp wanted to pursue the issue 
 but the press kept it alive as with the recruit scandal lists began circulating with names of people who had received money 
 within a matter of weeks <unk> magazines reported that members of the ruling ldp had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations 
 so far though there have been no allegations that the contributions the ldp members received amounted to <unk> 
 then the two camps <unk> the <unk> reports that chosen <unk> had donated directly to <unk> members were rapidly <unk> by statements that the south korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to ldp members 
 the <unk> admitted oct. N that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization and charged ldp members with receiving N million yen $ N and other opposition parties with taking about N million yen 
 on friday the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry including N yen $ N by prime minister <unk> <unk> 
 no one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal 
 direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign but both groups deny making direct donations 
 they say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately 
 the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many speak only japanese 
 that they retain korean <unk> and ties is a reflection of history their parents were shipped in as <unk> during the decades when japan occupied korea before world war ii and the discrimination that still faces koreans in japanese society 
 many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would <unk> to politicians the way many japanese do to win favor or support 
 both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad 
 but ldp members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in <unk> about the <unk> 's alleged donations <unk> that north korean money would be more suspect than south korean because north korea is communist and south korea is an ally 
 when robert mcduffie was N he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <unk> <unk> 
 unfortunately his mother had tickets for a recital by <unk> perlman the same night and she was <unk> about his attending

 young mcduffie 's first violin teacher was <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who taught in the <unk> public school system 
 he taught me how to play like a <unk> jokes the <unk> 
 i did n't learn to count until i got to <unk> 
 after studies at that <unk> 's <unk> division with an assistant to the legendary <unk> ivan <unk> he switched at the college level to miss delay mr. <unk> 's longtime assistant and ultimately his rival 
 i think i had to prove myself to her says mr. mcduffie 
 but she was always encouraging 
 she only put her foot down twice he continues 
 in my freshman year my <unk> was known as a party animal 
 she thought i was n't getting my practicing done 
 as the <unk> tells it his <unk> looking teacher put her hands on her <unk> <unk> her foot and said you 've just got to get the <unk> <unk> out of there 
 the second incident took place after mr. mcduffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself 
 miss delay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital 
 we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> he recalls and she said you hear the first note that <unk> 
 that 's the only note that 's truly in tune 
 that 's the most important experience i 've had with any teacher he says because she taught me how to listen 
 now when i play with <unk> the musicians often <unk> me on my <unk> 
 it was also at <unk> that mr. mcduffie discovered his <unk> for conservative <unk> american <unk> such as david diamond and samuel barber 
 after winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's violin <unk> mr. mcduffie was invited to play the work for the <unk> who was dying of cancer 
 barber was <unk> by the <unk> looking very pale recalls the <unk> who performed the work with a piano <unk> at the <unk> 's apartment 
 he did n't say much but what he said was important because it 's not in the score 
 there 's a beautiful <unk> <unk> he 'd kill me if he heard me say that throughout the first movement 
 the only time the violin has it is right at the end 
 it 's written <unk> in the score and i played it that way kind of <unk> 
 and he <unk> out <unk> <unk> sweet sweet 
 so we did it over he adds 
 i played very <unk> with the tip of the <unk> 
 if a <unk> is sensitive enough to bring down the <unk> volume at that point it makes the piece <unk> 
 i do n't know why barber never told anybody else 
 on <unk> stern 's recording it 's very <unk> 
 since leaving <unk> mr. mcduffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones 
 his guest appearance on the nbc soap opera another world <unk> musical <unk> 
 by contrast he 's won <unk> for his <unk> of william <unk> 's violin <unk> which he recently recorded for <unk> along with leonard bernstein 's engaging <unk> for violin solo <unk> and <unk> 
 mr. mcduffie 's sweet tone <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> make him an ideal <unk> of both works 
 aided by the <unk> playing of the st. louis <unk> under leonard <unk> 's direction this <unk> really swings 
 mr. <unk> 's violin <unk> which sounds more like a mildly <unk> <unk> for solo violin with <unk> <unk> <unk> until the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 but there are ample rewards in its <unk> slow sections and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 at avery fisher hall here mr. mcduffie was heard recently with mr. <unk> and the warsaw <unk> in more conventional fare <unk> 's <unk> violin <unk> in <unk> minor 
 his performance was so <unk> and driven that the <unk> rarely <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> played <unk> with a big <unk> sound that <unk> its size 
 whatever he plays mr. mcduffie finds satisfaction in the music itself something greater out there than me as he puts it during an interview at the manhattan apartment he shares with wife <unk> a literary <unk> 
 a normal person did not write the <unk> violin <unk> he declares 
 even when i hear it played badly i 'm still <unk> by the piece 
 if i could ever feel i 've contributed to it in some way then all the hard work has been worth it 
 ms. <unk> is a free-lance music writer in new york 
 are consumers too deep in <unk> 
 a lot of observers think so and if they 're right the whole economy as well as the <unk> among us could be hurt 
 a sudden forced <unk> by consumers who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity would damp the economy at a time when <unk> spending is slowing and <unk> governments ca n't readily take up the slack 
 and another wave of bad loans would further <unk> many <unk> lending institutions 
 the <unk> cite some worrisome trends 
 during the almost <unk> economic expansion inflation-adjusted gross national product disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen N N but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged N N 
 and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income personal income after taxes has hit a high of about N N N 
 however these figures do n't seem to worry thomas a. durkin an economist at the federal reserve board 
 in a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the national association of business economists in san francisco mr. durkin comments that installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier <unk> 
 he adds we are now <unk> a slowdown which if history is a guide could <unk> for a while 
 but what about the debt burden 
 mr. durkin doubts that there is some magic level at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income indicates economic problems 
 and more <unk> he says the debt burden measured other ways is not really in <unk> waters 
 the chart below shows why see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 the ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income though up a bit has n't climbed <unk> and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed 
 moreover the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be lower in this cycle than earlier mr. durkin says 
 he notes that some revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing 
 in addition he says longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of <unk> and the accompanying payment burden 
 and if you consider the changing distribution of credit mr. durkin says much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by <unk> families that is those probably best able to handle it 
 citing figures on home-equity loans he notes that N N of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts but the proportion rises to N N of homeowners in the $ <unk> income range and N N of homeowners with income above $ N 
 and much home-equity credit is used <unk> 
 the most frequent use is home improvement which presumably improves the value of the property mr. durkin says 
 so it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> at banks remain as the chart shows <unk> below some earlier highs see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 a severe recession could of course raise <unk> rates but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to <unk> as a major threat 
 in fact the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual <unk> in the household saving rate suggest that consumers conservative as ever are already <unk> their <unk> a bit more tightly 
 in july consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since january N 
 consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending bruce steinberg a merrill lynch economist says 
 as a result household debt appears to be stabilizing at around N N of gnp 
 consumers credit cards in hand are n't running <unk> through the shopping <unk> or putting the economy at any great risk 
 maidenform inc. <unk> to be intimate with its customers but not with the rest of the public 
 the <unk> maker of <unk> <unk> and <unk> enjoys one of the best-known brand images but its financial profile is closely <unk> by members of the founding family 
 there are very few companies that can <unk> of such a <unk> group says robert a. brawer N years old recently named president succeeding beatrice coleman his <unk> who remains chairman 
 we are a <unk> breed he <unk> 
 mrs. coleman N who declined to be interviewed is the maidenform strategist 
 sales have tripled during her <unk> tenure to about $ N million in N 
 maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide <unk> 
 the company sells image 
 its current ad campaign on which maidenform has spent more than $ N million since fall N does n't even show its underwear products but rather men like christopher <unk> star of the <unk> movies talking about their <unk> <unk> 
 the maidenform name is part of american pop culture says joan <unk> account supervisor of the campaign by levine <unk> <unk> & <unk> a new york ad firm 
 maidenform generated such <unk> campaigns as i <unk> i in my maidenform <unk> and the maidenform woman 
 you never know where she 'll turn up 
 <unk> on the brand is key says mr. brawer whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the u.s. 
 the intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly maidenform is a force to be <unk> with says david s. <unk> a special situations analyst at american securities corp. in new york 
 although working women are forced to wear the uniform of the day to retain their <unk> they are buying better quality more upscale intimate apparel he said 
 although mr. brawer 's appointment as president was long expected the move on sept. N <unk> the resignation of alan lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising 
 three days later mr. lesk was named president and chief executive officer of <unk> co. a competing intimate apparel division of <unk> inc 
 <unk> also owns <unk> another major intimate apparel maker 
 mr. lesk could n't be reached to comment 
 but maidenform officials say that after spending N years at maidenform mr. lesk N made it clear he wanted the top job 
 if you want the presidency of the company this is n't the firm to work for says james <unk> N who was named senior vice president of sales assuming some of the responsibilities of mr. lesk 
 the company <unk> the loss of mr. lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people 
 my style is less informal mr. brawer says 
 top officers insist maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership 
 you ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an <unk> chart one <unk> 
 it is fun competing as a private company mr. brawer says 
 you can think long range 
 other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way 
 <unk> was taken private by spectrum group in N for about $ N million 
 and last year <unk> holdings inc. went private for about $ N million 
 it was then split into <unk> apparel inc. the intimate apparel division and <unk> family products corp. which makes <unk> <unk> items and other products 
 publicly traded <unk> corp. which owns <unk> fair and <unk> lee corp. which owns <unk> co. are also strong forces in intimate apparel 
 buy-out offers for maidenform are n't <unk> says executive vice president david c. <unk> but they are n't taken very seriously 
 when he gets calls i do n't even have to <unk> with mrs. coleman mr. <unk> says 
 the company could command a good price in the market 
 over the past three and a half years apparel companies many of whom have strong brand names have been bought at about N N of sales says <unk> <unk> prudential-bache securities inc. apparel analyst 
 mr. brawer along with mrs. coleman and her daughter elizabeth an attorney who is vice chairman are the family members involved in the operations of maidenform which employs about N 
 mr. brawer 's wife <unk> and robert <unk> elizabeth 's husband round out the <unk> board 
 each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings 
 we are all very <unk> mr. brawer says 
 executives say mrs. coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations especially product development 
 in the late 1960s she designed a <unk> stretch <unk> that boosted sales 
 her father william rosenthal designed the <unk> making company 's first <unk> in the 1920s which he said gave women a <unk> form compared with the <unk> form they got from the flat <unk> used for support at the time 
 while mr. rosenthal introduced new <unk> designs his wife <unk> concentrated on sales and other financial matters 
 the name maidenform was <unk> by a third business partner <unk> <unk> 
 the company has N plants and distribution facilities in the u.s. puerto rico other parts of the caribbean and ireland 
 maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in omaha neb. and has N factory outlets with plans to add more 
 before joining maidenform in N mr. brawer who holds a <unk> degree in english from the university of chicago taught at the university of wisconsin 
 as a senior vice president he has headed the company 's designer <unk> division <unk> de la <unk> since its inception in N 
 to maintain exclusivity of that designer line it is n't labeled with the maidenform name 
 while the company has always been <unk> mr. brawer is n't the first person to <unk> into the family and subsequently head maidenform 
 mrs. coleman 's husband joseph a physician succeeded mrs. rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in N 
 china could <unk> its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the <unk> deficit 
 according to the report completed last month if china 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year the reserves would be wiped out either in N or N 
 a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports 
 the $ N billion of reserves china had in june would cover just that much 
 the report by the western government which declines to be identified concludes that a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below N N per <unk> 
 according to chinese customs figures import growth has slowed in recent months dropping to N N in july and N N in august from the year-earlier periods compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half 
 but before import growth slowed china 's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves 
 the $ N billion level in june marked a drop from $ N billion at the end of april 
 china 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ N billion in june N from $ N billion the previous september 
 china might <unk> off a crisis if it acts as <unk> as it did to arrest the N decline when beijing <unk> the <unk> on foreign-exchange spending and <unk> the currency 
 but this time china faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <unk> square killings june N 
 for example china 's <unk> income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist <unk> since june N 
 revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $ N billion down from $ N billion last year 
 because of this and the huge trade gap the deficit in china 's current account which measures trade in goods and services plus certain <unk> transfers of funds is expected to widen sharply from the $ N billion deficit last year 
 the western government report suggests a number of scenarios for china 's <unk> balance two of which are considered most likely 
 in one imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of N N and N N recorded during the first seven months and the <unk> deficit widens to $ N billion 
 in N china had a record deficit of $ N billion 
 the other scenario assumes that beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months 
 in this case china would still finish the year with a <unk> deficit of $ N billion based on projections that imports for all of this year grow N N and exports N N 
 if china were still on good terms with foreign lenders it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the <unk> deficit 
 but since june foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to china 
 even if borrowing <unk> commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before 
 in addition economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of china 's deteriorating political and economic environment 
 on top of all this <unk> <unk> are expected to peak in N to N 
 with less capital coming in china 's balance of payments would suffer 
 the western government report 's first scenario assumes a N N reduction in foreign borrowing and a N N <unk> in foreign direct investment 
 in the second foreign borrowing is projected to grow N N and investment to drop N N 
 but in either case the report says china 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves which are used to finance the <unk> 
 in the first scenario the reserves would be exhausted next year and in the second they would be wiped out in N 
 <unk> holding ag parent of the swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group said its group sales rose N N in the first nine months of the year to N billion francs $ N billion 
 the company reported good gains in all of its divisions 
 <unk> also said it expects a considerable rise in N group profit from the N <unk> $ N million net in N 
 new <unk> investments inc. said it closed the acquisition of <unk> glass co. from <unk> co. a <unk> ill. maker of <unk> home products 
 terms were n't disclosed 
 <unk> a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and <unk> industries had sales last year of about $ N million 
 new <unk> investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry 
 ralph brown was N feet over minnesota when both jets on his falcon N <unk> out 
 at N feet he says he and his <unk> were looking for an interstate or a <unk> to land 
 at N feet the engines <unk> 
 but knowing that <unk> would probably ground him for repairs mr. brown <unk> his stop in nearby chicago and set course to get his load a few hundred <unk> to the memphis <unk> hub on time 
 had he been a little less <unk> i 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the <unk> bar mr. brown says 
 but he flies for federal express corp. perhaps the <unk> thing in corporate america to the green <unk> 
 federal 's employees work long hours and seem to <unk> on the stress of racing the <unk> 
 like mr. brown they sometimes go to surprising <unk> to meet that <unk> corporate goal delivering the goods on time 
 they are a <unk> to federal 's management which since the company 's founding N years ago has had its way with its work force an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry 
 that may soon change 
 this month federal 's N pilots including some N acquired along with tiger international inc. in february will decide whether to <unk> the powerful air line pilots association as their bargaining agent 
 the election which would bring the first major union to federal 's u.s. operations has <unk> new <unk> against devoted veterans such as mr. brown 
 it has also rattled federal 's strongly <unk> management which is already <unk> with <unk> <unk> operations and with falling profits 
 a union sooner or later has to have an adversary and it has to have a victory frederick w. smith federal 's chairman and chief executive says with <unk> 
 in our formula we do n't have any losers except the competition 
 what managers really fear is that the <unk> movement could spread beyond the pilots 
 under federal transportation law a government mediator is attempting to <unk> the <unk> of tiger 's job <unk> into federal 's 
 depending on the outcome the merged company may face union elections this fall among <unk> <unk> <unk> workers stock <unk> and flight <unk> 
 these groups constitute up to N N of its work force 
 unions would have a <unk> effect on the whole culture of the company says bernard la <unk> a professor at ohio state university at columbus and a federal consultant 
 that culture carefully <unk> by mr. smith leaves little if any room for unions 
 since founding the company the <unk> vietnam <unk> who is still only N years old has <unk> an <unk> of combat 
 flights are <unk> 
 mr. smith 's managers have at times been called <unk> <unk> <unk> 's guerrillas 
 the <unk> <unk> award the navy <unk> for a job well done is <unk> on federal 's workers who <unk> the call of duty 
 competitors are known as the enemy 
 to reinforce employees ' <unk> mr. smith pays well 
 he also lets workers <unk> steam through an elaborate <unk> procedure and as a <unk> fly free in empty <unk> seats 
 he gives <unk> talks in periodic family <unk> <unk> internationally on <unk> the company 's own television network 
 and with many of his N workers mr. smith 's <unk> attitude has caught on 
 james cleveland a <unk> who earned a <unk> <unk> for figuring out how to get a major customer 's <unk> load to its <unk> by N a.m. considers himself far more than a <unk> 
 we do n't just hand the customer the package 
 that 's just the beginning he says 
 in <unk> we run the show 
 david <unk> a longtime pilot <unk> at the mere suggestion that a union might <unk> with his flight schedule 
 this is america he says 
 nobody has the right to tell me how much i can work 
 such attitudes have given federal flexibility not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean 
 the company deliberately <unk> stretching employees ' schedules to the limit 
 but though <unk> work as many as N hours a week during the autumn rush they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum <unk> 
 pilots as well routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are <unk> during seasonal lows 
 the operational freedom has also given federal a leg up on archrival united parcel service inc. the nation 's largest employer of united <unk> of <unk> members 
 ups wo n't discuss its labor practices but according to mr. cleveland a former ups employee and others union work rules prohibit ups drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans 
 because ups drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the <unk> say these <unk> packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late 
 labor problems are the last thing mr. smith needs right now 
 although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be it also has brought problems 
 it more than doubled federal 's long-term debt to $ N billion thrust the company into unknown territory heavy cargo and suddenly expanded its landing rights to N countries from four 
 federal on its own had n't been doing very well overseas 
 it had <unk> in its attempt to get into asia where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes <unk> on certain routes 
 on routes to south america the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were <unk> 
 in europe business suffered as federal bought several local companies only to have the managers quit 
 these and other problems squeezed federal 's profit margins last year to N N down from more than N N annually in the first half of the decade 
 earnings have plummeted too in each of the past three quarters 
 in the fiscal first period ended aug. N profit fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share mostly because of the tiger merger federal says 
 federal 's stock price however has held up well driven in part by the general <unk> of airline stocks analysts say 
 since trading as low as $ N a share in may federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 they closed friday at $ N down N cents on the day 
 there 's a certain irony in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase 
 tiger itself was founded by a band of <unk> <unk> who had <unk> supplies over the <unk> from india to china during world war ii 
 in the early 1970s mr. smith <unk> his fledgling company on tiger 's innovation of <unk> and <unk> operations 
 but from early on tiger 's workers <unk> while federal 's never have 
 federal express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually 
 analysts expect federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending feb. N when the company should begin benefiting from tiger 's extra flights <unk> planes and landing rights 
 until then they expect the cost of <unk> the two carriers to continue <unk> profits 
 for now the union issue is the most <unk> of federal 's tiger problems management believes 
 although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers mr. smith does n't <unk> what he considers <unk> 
 when a large group of pilots once signed <unk> opposing <unk> and compensation changes he called a meeting in a company <unk> and dressed them down for challenging his authority 
 he then made most of the changes pilots say 
 that sort of approach however has n't worked since the addition of tiger 
 its N workers who had battled tiger 's management for years over <unk> were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically <unk> 
 soon after the merger moreover federal 's management asked tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement <unk> that they could be fired any time without cause or notice 
 when the pilots refused the company <unk> it 
 mr. smith angered federal 's pilots too 
 in his <unk> to seal the deal with tiger chairman saul steinberg last august mr. smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago that any <unk> acquired in future mergers would be <unk> put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that <unk> work schedules pay and career options 
 the tiger merger agreement <unk> that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure 
 mr. smith is trying hard to <unk> the anger 
 and even some <unk> pilots say his <unk> and popularity among the many former military <unk> could be tough to beat 
 a lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against fred smith says <unk> <unk> a <unk> pilot and union activist 
 mr. smith and other top federal executives have met with tiger workers in los angeles ohio new york alaska asia and europe 
 recently they have appeared every few weeks in <unk> type <unk> <unk> <unk> arguments 
 in one video mr. smith defended his agreement to merge the <unk> lists 
 he said mr. steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly 
 regulators as well might have <unk> the deal if tiger 's pilots had n't been protected he said 
 furthermore mr. smith added our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice 
 it does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change 
 already the fight has been costly 
 the <unk> controversy along with the <unk> dispute has been turned over to the mediator 
 meanwhile the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists and that is costing federal a big number says james <unk> executive vice president and chief operating officer 
 the issue has also cost federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots 
 they were willing to <unk> us because we had n't shown any <unk> any resistance says william <unk> a <unk> pilot and <unk> federal veteran 
 adds john <unk> a N <unk> and past chairman of the <unk> flight advisory board they 've made all these <unk> gestures to the flying tiger pilots and for us nothing 
 such <unk> could prove <unk> in the union vote 
 a large majority of the N former tiger <unk> support the union according to a union study 
 but though most of the N federal pilots are believed opposed it is unclear just how much their loyalty to mr. smith has been eroded 
 the fight has turned <unk> and among pilots at least has shattered the <unk> de corps that mr. smith worked so hard to build 
 <unk> pilots have held <unk> parties 
 some younger pilots say they have had to endure <unk> <unk> by senior pilots while flying across the country 
 and for now at least the competition is n't the only enemy 
 barney <unk> a N <unk> and leader of the <unk> forces said he has received two <unk> death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire <unk> by a <unk> 
 the pilots are either for us or extremely against us he says with a sigh 
 <unk> corp. said it obtained a $ N million export order for <unk> recovery vehicles and related support equipment 
 <unk> declined to say what country placed the order 
 the company said it received an order for N of the vehicles which retrieve tanks and other <unk> vehicles when they break down or are damaged and an option for N more 
 delivery is to begin in early N 
 <unk> produces products for defense industrial commercial and construction markets 
 the senate convicted u.s. district judge <unk> hastings of florida of eight impeachment articles removing the <unk> judge from his $ <unk> lifetime job 
 mr. hastings 's case was particularly <unk> because it marked the first time a federal official was <unk> and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him 
 in N mr. hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ N bribe in a case before him the central charge on which the senate convicted him 
 he was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial 
 with no floor debate the senate on friday voted N to <unk> mr. hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe five votes more than needed 
 conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove judge hastings from office 
 he was found not guilty of three charges involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive government investigation 
 the senate did n't vote on six lesser charges 
 although mr. hastings had been acquitted by a jury lawmakers handling the prosecution in congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual 
 instead they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust <unk> of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases 
 mr. hastings faced the senators and sat <unk> during the first two <unk> votes then quickly left the chamber 
 in an <unk> news conference on the capitol steps he denounced the senators ' action 
 their opinion is <unk> of the wisdom of the <unk> ' teaching regarding impeachment mr. hastings said 
 for the future he said he would run for governor of florida 
 mr. hastings was appointed to the federal bench by president carter in N and was one of the few black federal judges in the country 
 while he packed the senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case 
 following the impeachment conviction dr. benjamin <unk> executive director of the national association for the <unk> of <unk> people issued a <unk> statement warning that the hastings case could set a dangerous precedent but adding we must respect the considered judgment of the senate

 what next for the <unk> fbi agent with the heart of gold 
 a spinoff series of course 
 there are plenty of worse <unk> for shows and most of them had already made the fall lineup 
 a <unk> raising some <unk> <unk> 
 a <unk> mother raising some <unk> <unk> models 
 a bunch of <unk> and <unk> suits <unk> as <unk> <unk> 
 in that context robert <unk> 's <unk> performance as the <unk> even <unk> veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most 
 week by week on mancuso fbi nbc <unk> N p.m <unk> he <unk> around the crime styles of the rich famous and powerful of the washington scene a loose <unk> on deck at the fbi 
 over the first few weeks mancuso fbi has <unk> straight from the <unk> which is either a <unk> <unk> at <unk> or a lack of <unk> or both 
 the opening show featured a secretary of defense <unk> accused of <unk> a la john tower 
 when his secretary is found floating dead in the <unk> 's pool mancuso is called in to investigate 
 last week a young black girl claimed she had been <unk> by a white police officer a la <unk> <unk>

 along the way we 're introduced to the supporting cast a <unk> <unk> secretary <unk> <unk> her real name honest a <unk> young boss <unk> <unk> another <unk> <unk> who 's also an <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> and a <unk> expert charles <unk> 
 if all of this seems a little <unk> it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot <unk> 
 the usual suspects are found to be guilty then not guilty then guilty but of a different crime 
 in last week 's rape case for example the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest and the biggest <unk> are the politicians who exploit the case 
 most of all though the show is redeemed by the character of mancuso 
 what makes the veteran fbi man so <unk> is his <unk> <unk> earned we discover when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s 
 he was n't protecting the freedom <unk> he was <unk> them as <unk> 
 this is not the mississippi burning scenario that <unk> his young colleagues kid you 've been reading classic <unk> too long mancuso says 
 back in N the fbi had five black agents 
 three were <unk> for j. edgar <unk> and two <unk> his house 
 at the core of mr. <unk> 's mancuso is his <unk> <unk> 
 he describes a reporter as miss first amendment 
 he describes a <unk> <unk> as <unk> williams 
 and when he 's told try a little <unk> he <unk> back i 'm going home to try a little <unk> 
 yet for all his <unk> he 's at heart a <unk> <unk> a <unk> with a secret crush on truth justice and the american way 
 he 's the kind of guy who <unk> <unk> flags 
 if mancuso fbi has an intriguing central character it also has a major flaw 
 it 's wildly <unk> 
 executive producers steve sohmer and jeff <unk> and <unk> ken <unk> and steve <unk> have <unk> this show up to the breaking point

 you are a <unk> a <unk> in a $ N suit 
 one more word and you are out on a park bench <unk> 
 finally of course the boss gives in but he 's still <unk> i find myself explaining anything to teddy kennedy you 'll be chasing stolen cars in <unk> 
 in fact throughout mancuso fbi we do n't get words or lines we get <unk> 
 witnesses <unk> <unk> <unk> a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the <unk> <unk> creatures who try to <unk> down every decent man who raises his voice 
 and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his <unk> how the hell can you live with yourself he <unk> at a politician 
 you twist people 's trust 
 you built your career on <unk> and hate 
 the <unk> will be here years after the polls close 
 in each show mancuso gets to <unk> similar <unk> 
 where the hell are they <unk> <unk> live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump 
 you 're the real criminal here and what you did was n't just a murder it was a crime against <unk> 
 and at least once a show someone <unk> the line get off that <unk> 
 now that 's advice the writers should take to heart 
 they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising plot lines and they 're <unk> it 
 why when a key witness disappears does mancuso trash her apartment <unk> down <unk> <unk> walls 
 it 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction all to add more <unk> to a script that 's already <unk> on <unk> 
 that 's not plot 
 that 's not character 
 that 's <unk> 
 there is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where mancuso <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> to his dead partner david 
 asked to say a few words he pulls out his <unk> piece of paper and tries to talk but he 's too <unk> up to get the words out 
 he <unk> on the piece of paper in frustration then turns and walks away 
 it was a <unk> moving moment for series television and robert <unk> 's acting <unk> in the <unk> 
 there 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of mancuso fbi 
 if the show 's <unk> could just let themselves be quiet for a little they might just hear it

 texaco inc. has purchased an <unk> company in texas for $ N million its first major acquisition since its legal <unk> with pennzoil co. began more than four years ago 
 the white plains n.y. oil company said friday that it had acquired <unk> production corp. a subsidiary of <unk> energy holdings inc. for $ N million in cash with the rest to be paid in shares of a new <unk> issue of preferred stock 
 <unk> which holds properties in N oil and gas fields in south texas will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves 
 the fields contain <unk> reserves of N billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil 
 this acquisition is another indication of texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base said chief executive officer james w. <unk> 
 texaco has also been attempting to sell oil properties 
 at least two years ago the company put N million barrels of oil reserves on the block 
 they were either too small or <unk> to maintain the company said 
 not all of those <unk> have yet been sold 
 texaco acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> 's properties are high quality and near other fields texaco already owns a company spokeswoman said 
 texaco like many other oil companies has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves 
 texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its <unk> with pennzoil and then on new york investor carl c. icahn 's attempt to take over the company 
 pennzoil had sued texaco for improperly <unk> with its acquisition of a portion of <unk> oil co 
 eventually texaco which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation settled its fight with pennzoil for $ N billion in N 
 mr. icahn who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in texaco just last summer 
 completion of texaco 's acquisition of <unk> is subject to government approval under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act 
 <unk> inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its capital housing and mortgage partners inc. trust to between N cents and N cents a share from between N cents and N cents for the year ending june N N 
 the change in expected cash distributions from the <unk> real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs said jay r. cohen <unk> executive vice president 
 <unk> which sponsors <unk> is a world-wide real estate investment firm 
 h&r block inc. had net income of $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year ended april N

 <unk> ag 's chairman said the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to <unk> a raider 
 amid heavy buying of shares in belgium 's largest insurer maurice <unk> also warned in an interview that a white knight in buying out a raider could leave speculators with big losses on their ag stock 
 since the beginning of the year the stock has nearly doubled giving ag a market value of about N billion belgian francs $ N billion 
 the most likely white knight would be societe generale de <unk> s.a. which already owns N N of ag and which itself is controlled by cie financiere de suez the <unk> french financial conglomerate 
 but mr. <unk> said a rescue also could involve <unk> mutual life insurance co. which owns N N of ag 
 ag is hardly alone in its anxiety

 in france suez and <unk> assurances s.a. both have been on the <unk> for giant acquisitions suez last month acquired control of <unk> <unk> the <unk> european insurance company after a takeover battle with cie <unk> 
 mr. <unk> said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since <unk> 
 but he estimated that a raider would have been able to <unk> no more than N N of the shares in recent months 
 aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions mr. <unk> has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders among them <unk> union des assurances de paris and suez all based in france 
 they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag he said 
 any raider would find it hard to crack ag 's <unk> 
 a syndicate of shareholders holds just under N N of ag mr. <unk> said and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any ag shares 
 aside from generale de <unk> and <unk> the syndicate includes <unk> <unk> a belgian savings bank and various family interests 
 a generale spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control 
 <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment 
 even without bid talk this year 's surge in prices for brussels real estate has excited interest in ag 
 the company says those holdings constitute the <unk> real-estate portfolio in belgium 
 with the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in panama one of the many <unk> questions the bush administration will <unk> is this is the national security council staff big enough and does it have enough clout to do its job of <unk> foreign policy 
 president bush 's national security adviser <unk> gen. <unk> scowcroft came into office in january intent on making the nsc staff <unk> and more disciplined than it had been during the reagan administration 
 gen. scowcroft was a member of the tower commission which investigated the iran-contra affair 
 he was all too aware of how a large <unk> <unk> nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly <unk> president reagan 's second term 
 so following both the style he pursued as president ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the tower commission gen. scowcroft has <unk> the nsc staff and tried to ensure that it <unk> to its assigned tasks namely gathering the views of the state department pentagon and intelligence community serving as an honest broker in <unk> that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out 
 the tower commission specifically said that the nsc staff should be small and warned against letting energetic <unk> like <unk> col. oliver north strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the state department pentagon or central intelligence agency 
 however the panama episode has raised questions about whether the nsc staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues 
 during the coup attempt and its aftermath nsc staffers were stretched very thin says one senior administration official 
 it 's a very small shop 
 gen. scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now but is weighing that possibility the official adds 
 the nsc staff does n't have the <unk> that i believe is required to have an effective <unk> process says frank <unk> a former pentagon aide who now runs the center for security policy a conservative washington <unk> 
 the problem with this administration i think is that by design it has greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the nsc 
 the national security council itself was established in N because policy makers <unk> a need in an increasingly complex world for a formal system within the white house to make sure that communications <unk> smoothly between the president and the state department pentagon and intelligence agencies 
 by law the council includes the president vice president and secretaries of state and defense 
 in practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve as <unk> members 
 but the size shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide 
 that task is one of washington 's <unk> problems 
 in the bush white house the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about N from about N in N administration officials say 
 administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis 
 but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the nsc <unk> most experienced in latin america <unk> briggs was gone 
 he had just resigned at least in part because of a <unk> with assistant secretary of state bernard <unk> over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra rebels 
 the absence of mr. briggs underscored the possible <unk> of the current nsc staff 
 both gen. scowcroft and his deputy robert gates are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs 
 gen. scowcroft is particularly <unk> in arms control and mr. gates has spent years studying soviet politics and society 
 both have become <unk> of president bush 
 but neither has an extensive background in latin america the middle east or asia 
 in those areas the role of nsc staffers under them therefore have become more important 
 gen. scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that nsc staffers working in relative <unk> will take over <unk> and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced state department and pentagon bureaus 
 but just as every previous nsc adviser has gen. scowcroft now will have to <unk> at what point the nsc staff becomes too lean and too <unk>

 frank lavelle who at the time was the marketing director for sperry in <unk> fla. admitted participating in a scheme to bribe <unk> <unk> the navy official 
 mr. <unk> who left the navy in N pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy bribery and <unk> charges 
 the bribery scheme took place between N and N according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with mr. lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in <unk> va 
 sperry merged with <unk> corp. to become unisys corp. in late N 
 court documents filed by prosecutors indicate mr. <unk> tried to steer to sperry a <unk> dollar contract to <unk> maintenance of certain navy electronics <unk> 
 mr. <unk> among other things illegally provided mr. lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give sperry an unfair advantage in the competition the documents said 
 sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work 
 documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that mr. lavelle and his fellow <unk> requested and obtained approval of the scheme from <unk> sperry officials because the payment which <unk> <unk> requested was so large 
 charles <unk> a former unisys vice president and james neal a former company consultant have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes

 he <unk> the contest on larry king 's radio show on pat <unk> 's television show and on the <unk> cable television network 
 he talked about it in every speech he made as he <unk> the country promoting his books which <unk> handy <unk> advice on using government information for fun and profit 
 mr. lesko figured he would be flooded with <unk> by now 
 after all he says we 've got like N million bureaucrats 
 and in addition to the $ N he has promised the winner a my favorite bureaucrat <unk> and offered each of two <unk> $ N 
 so far though mr. lesko has received only one entry 
 to make matters worse the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat a woman from the new york state department of taxation and finance who <unk> her boss 
 mr. lesko who is making the rules as he goes has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats 
 but he says he would prefer to get <unk> from <unk> folks 
 he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest 
 newspapers including this one have generally ignored his news releases 
 talk show hosts quickly change the topic 
 but mr. lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon <unk> the contest 
 is the government not helping anybody asks <unk> murray an assistant to mr. lesko 
 mr. lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation 
 people hate to write he says 
 maybe people do n't believe i want to give this money away 
 maybe americans are just so <unk> with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while 
 if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat <unk> something mr. lesko admits i 'd get N <unk>

 ford motor co. and saab-scania ab of sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return 
 with the collapse of the talks friday european analysts expect ford to intensify its pursuit of british luxury car maker jaguar plc which is scrambling to fend off a hostile ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with ford 's archrival general motors corp 
 saab meanwhile is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business 
 saab said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers 
 among the possible suitors is italy 's fiat s.p a analysts said last week 
 ford and saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long-term business sense to both parties 
 individuals close to the ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the no. N u.s. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology 
 ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury car markets 
 in addition ford and saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations 
 but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far 
 some european analysts speculated that officials of saab 's highly profitable <unk> truck operation balked at <unk> any of their <unk> 
 meanwhile ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market 
 saab 's problems were underscored friday when the company announced that its car division had a N billion kronor $ N million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than saab-scania had forecast in its first-half report last month 
 overall saab-scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged N N to N billion swedish kronor $ N million from N billion kronor $ N million a year earlier 
 industry analysts in europe said the most likely suitor for saab now is fiat 
 saab and fiat have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto <unk> that became the foundation of saab 's N model fiat 's <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> 
 last month saab-scania chief executive <unk> <unk> said his company has had talks with fiat about a broader alliance 
 but the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said 
 as for ford analysts expect the end of the saab play will allow the u.s. auto maker to focus its resources on the <unk> struggle with gm for a stake in jaguar 
 the failure of the saab talks makes it even more crucial for ford to be <unk> in the jaguar contest said stephen reitman european auto industry analyst at <unk> & drew in london 
 ford faces an <unk> fight for jaguar however 
 jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm <unk> up by the end of the month 
 gm meanwhile is <unk> a delegation of members of the british parliament who are <unk> the auto maker 's <unk> operations in detroit 
 a gm spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the jaguar situation 
 but ford clearly views jaguar as a prize worth fighting for since the company 's <unk> brand image would give ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s. 
 last week ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its <unk> scorpio sedan in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name 
 so despite the <unk> <unk> analysts say ford by last friday had boosted its jaguar holding to about N N of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from N N early last week 
 about N million jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on london 's stock exchange friday and jaguar shares moved up N pence to N pence $ N 
 on the u.s. over-the-counter market jaguar 's american depositary receipts rose N cents to $ N

 the dallas cowboys are looking at a <unk> situation struggling to pull ahead of the atlanta <unk> 
 up in his stadium box their new and controversial owner <unk> jerry jones watches <unk> as the team <unk> up to the <unk> line 
 mr. jones takes heart 
 there in the center of the pack is <unk> <unk> <unk> the key to the cowboys ' comeback strategy 
 so key in fact that mr. jones signed him in april for $ N million over the next six years a record for a <unk> 
 he 's a genuine <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. jones 
 with three minutes left on the <unk> mr. <unk> takes the <unk> steps back and fires a <unk> pass straight into the hands of an atlanta defensive back 
 the crowd <unk> mr. jones <unk> his head the cowboys lose the game 
 a few days after that sept. N game mr. <unk> broke a finger <unk> him for weeks 
 <unk> the <unk> of professional sports 
 for mr. jones losing his <unk> temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has <unk> the dallas cowboys and this year much of the national football league 
 once fat and happy the cowboys now are losing games fans and money 
 last year the team ended up $ N million in the red on $ N million in revenue 
 it has some of the highest costs in the league 
 its attendance is off N N from six years ago 
 at the very least mr. jones who <unk> the society circuit as <unk> as his bench can take comfort in one fact these days he is n't alone 
 nearly half the owners of the N national football league teams are losing money the result of flat attendance aging stadiums and more than anything <unk> salaries for star players like mr. <unk> 
 last year the top N players on each nfl team took home an average $ N a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball 
 <unk> draft picks have done even better average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ N this year up N N from N 
 it 's a vicious circle says art <unk> owner of the cleveland <unk> 
 one team pays so much and the other pays more 
 we just do n't have that kind of income stream 
 all this is causing <unk> in professional football 
 owners largely <unk> in the past are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue <unk> some revolutionary ideas in the process 
 though not intentionally the cowboys ' mr. jones has come to represent this new breed of owner 
 shortly after buying N N of the team from <unk> <unk> bright for $ N million and <unk> of the cowboys ' <unk> bottom line the <unk> mr. jones set about his own round of team cuts 
 first he <unk> <unk> tom <unk> the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five <unk> <unk> and N consecutive winning seasons 
 in dallas mr. <unk> has a standing just shy of <unk> 
 <unk> sentiment flooded the local press a crude <unk> <unk> said one writer a real <unk> said another who in the hell does he think he is wrote a third 
 for mr. jones it was just the beginning 
 he quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half shut down a <unk> dance academy and in july announced plans to sell valley ranch the team 's <unk> practice camp and the most <unk> training facility in the nfl 
 mr. jones calls the ranch the pentagon of <unk> 
 it is a <unk> of halls that <unk> film rooms elaborate <unk> and <unk> centers that testify to a richer more <unk> era 
 he likes to tell the <unk> of how he got lost on the <unk> ranch during an early visit took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help 
 i said somebody come get me 
 i 'm at extension N 
 with a new day <unk> on the sport mr. jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury 
 it 's just not cost efficient he says 
 the place costs nearly $ N million a year to maintain 
 when he sells it he says the cowboys will move to a more practical read affordable <unk> practice field near texas stadium 
 and as for tom <unk> well in mr. jones 's mind he had played out his winning years 
 after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he says 
 football has long been mr. jones 's passion both on and off the field 
 an arkansas native he started at guard on the <unk> N university of arkansas team that won a national championship 
 after college he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock and in N led an aborted attempt to buy the san diego <unk> 
 years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> production corp. an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock 
 so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. <unk> 
 he tapped <unk> johnson a <unk> on the N university of arkansas <unk> and the head coach at the university of miami where he led the <unk> to five winning seasons and a national championship in N 
 whatever mr. johnson 's <unk> in the hearts and minds of many dallas fans he is no tom <unk> 
 seven games and after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old 
 in fact the last time they played this badly was in N their opening season 
 average attendance at their games about N last year continues flat 
 mr. jones is attacking the problem on several fronts 
 he continues to <unk> the team trading <unk> running back <unk> walker to the minnesota <unk> this month for a slew of players and future draft picks 
 to try to draw more fans he has dropped <unk> ticket prices from $ N to $ N 
 but the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit 
 it 's simple says <unk> hunt who owns the kansas city chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ N to an average $ N 
 if we did n't increase prices we 'd be in the red 
 mr. jones has also <unk> up his marketing staff to sell the N luxury suites <unk> texas stadium his deal with <unk> bright included operating rights for the stadium 
 the suites are <unk> have <unk> bars and <unk> <unk> and offer a clear view of the field all for a sale price of $ N to $ N million depending on their size and location 
 mr. jones has been taking prospective <unk> owners onto the field during practice to let them <unk> <unk> with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time 
 the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold 
 today N have 
 gate receipts are only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash 
 the biggest is the nfl 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games 
 last year the cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ N million 
 the team additionally earns between $ N million and $ N million for local radio and television broadcast rights 
 mr. jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights 
 he is also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games 
 mr. jones whose <unk> voice and <unk> ways <unk> an intense businessman who works <unk> days is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days 
 he calls the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and has played his part in the bidding wars 
 besides signing mr. <unk> to a sizable contract mr. jones has agreed to pay <unk> <unk> steve <unk> $ N million over the next four years 
 this wage inflation is bleeding the nfl dry the owners contend 
 soon only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams predicts john j. <unk> jr. an investment banker with salomon brothers who handled the cowboys sale 
 to tackle the problem nfl owners have proposed setting a <unk> wage scale to try to rein in salaries 
 details of the plan which would go into effect in N are <unk> but each player would apparently be paid a base salary <unk> to his position and ability 
 bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance 
 the nfl players association meanwhile contends that athletes are paid a wage <unk> with their ability to draw fans and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management not players ' salaries 
 the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too 
 many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are <unk> dated stadium contracts 
 most of the owners must pay up to N N of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old 
 in chicago for example size is the issue 
 we have the worst lease in the nfl contends michael b. <unk> the president of the chicago bears and a <unk> of george <unk> who founded the nfl 's predecessor organization 
 we 're in a <unk> area with millions of bear fans and only a small number can be <unk> 
 when the lease expires in N he says it 's got to be changed 
 this year the nfl also imposed an <unk> limit on teams going into training camp down from N in a move meant to trim payroll costs 
 and the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract which expires after this season 
 the current contract pays the nfl $ N billion 
 owners say they expect the league to demand a N N increase despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings 
 an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn 
 the changes have n't come easy 
 like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself is in turmoil 
 the new breed of team owner mr. jones included has been fighting the nfl bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs and the battle has produced a form of <unk> gridlock 
 in july N nfl owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install jim <unk> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete <unk> 
 mr. <unk> is perceived by some owners as a <unk> for the old guard 
 earlier this month another effort to choose a commissioner failed 
 the owners meet again tomorrow 
 for his part jerry jones says he 's in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that 
 he puts in busy <unk> weeks excluding game days and on one recent afternoon <unk> questions in the course of an hour from a tv producer his <unk> marketing manager a <unk> customer and a <unk> of arkansas reporters 
 to keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to <unk> his staff in dallas 
 when i made this investment i made it on a lifetime basis he explains 
 i 'm not here to make money by <unk> the team later on 
 while the cowboys may not be the best investment now i do n't accept they ca n't be in the future 
 besides to a large extent mr. jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team even though it keeps losing 
 owning the cowboys has bought him <unk> to a <unk> life that drilling for oil in arkansas just did n't provide 
 there is the new private jet the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the best parties and television appearances on shows such as prime time live 
 a few weeks ago mr. jones even <unk> elizabeth taylor in his private <unk> at texas stadium 
 you 're in the <unk> seat every day in this job he says 
 how <unk> <unk> of robert goldberg to use the form of <unk> <unk> journalism to explain his perception of days of rage in his television <unk> leisure & arts <unk> N 
 he <unk> <unk> <unk> for her <unk> presentation of <unk> journalism judging her project as <unk> <unk> 
 was not the title very clear 
 one example he gives she did n't ask why the palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones 
 really now did she have to ask 
 were not the pictures and <unk> which have been continuing news <unk> answers enough 
 mr. goldberg contends that even as propaganda the film fails because it presents only one view 
 of course the <unk> complain about their treatment of course the <unk> feel put upon 
 but his complaint that days of rage does n't contain balanced comments from <unk> about how badly the <unk> are <unk> is irrelevant 
 it 's like doing a <unk> on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how <unk> white south <unk> are 
 this film did <unk> how long the <unk> <unk> has existed by <unk> the conflict to the days of world war i when the british tried to guarantee both a jewish state and a palestinian state without <unk> how it was to be done 
 well days of rage airing with <unk> packaging and after repeated delays was a beginning 
 every issue is <unk> 
 this film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media 
 now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only

 president bush wants the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week 
 mr. bush asked congress to raise to $ N billion from $ N billion the amount of money defense secretary dick cheney may shift among the pentagon 's individual programs projects and activities allowing him to ease the pain that the gramm-rudman budget law was intended to <unk> 
 if the request is approved by both the house and senate mr. cheney would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money according to senate budget analysts 
 that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has 
 it 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs said chairman james <unk> d. <unk> of the senate budget committee who said he would oppose the request 
 that is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that gramm-rudman is supposed to impose he said 
 the president 's request did n't indicate how mr. cheney would shift the money 
 a pentagon official said the request was made to give the department maximum flexibility to deal with the cuts 
 last week budget director richard darman structured the $ N billion spending reduction half of which must come from defense to impose a little bit more discipline by applying cuts to each individual program project or activity in the budget 
 that would give agencies less ability to <unk> over things he told reporters 
 under the deficit-reduction law N N of the pentagon 's money and N N of other agencies ' money has been canceled 
 lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending <unk> measure has been signed into law 
 rochester telephone corp. said it completed its purchase of urban telephone corp. of <unk> wis. the second-largest <unk> independent telephone company in that state 
 rochester telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of urban telephone but a price was n't disclosed 
 urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in wisconsin 
 since june rochester telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other wisconsin firms 
 a bill that would permit the securities and exchange commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some wall street firms which argue that the legislation is unnecessary 
 the legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee and the senate securities subcommittee 
 richard breeden the new chairman of the sec has n't taken a formal position on the bill which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the sec additional authority during market <unk> 
 however he recently told the senate banking committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of <unk> which are frequently used to issue bridge loans 
 the bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions 
 since such loans are often <unk> through the sale of high-risk high-yield junk bonds the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with wall street firms issuing bridge loans 
 but some wall street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted 
 in a july N letter to the senate securities subcommittee first boston corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the N market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate 
 first boston whose holding company cs first boston group is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on wall street said it is also concerned that once the sec has the power to monitor holding companies it will try to regulate their activities 
 the proposal while <unk> i think can be <unk> misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken rather than strengthen the control the sec has exercised for N years over the financial <unk> and viability of <unk> michael <unk> managing director of first boston said in an interview 
 the bill would <unk> scarce resources of the commission away from <unk> into areas which simply have no way of affecting <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 sources in the industry and on capitol hill say a compromise that would <unk> the industry while addressing the sec 's concerns may be possible 
 an aide to the senate securities subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure but adds nobody is <unk> to the language in the bill 
 edward o'brien president of the securities industry association said that the <unk> trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the sec 's goals 
 mr. o'brien will elaborate on the <unk> 's position in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee this week a spokesman said 
 this letter was inspired by david <unk> 's sept. N editorial-page article about <unk> <unk> man in the middle of drug trafficking 
 i 've organized a series of exchanges <unk> and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists 
 in any matters between us and the cubans there can be no <unk> consequently i 've become familiar not only with cuban art and artists but also with cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government 
 despite levels of <unk> <unk> and <unk> frustration of <unk> proportion these projects all remain in my mind valuable and well worth the effort 
 there is a simple reason for this the cuban people 
 let me immediately put limits to whatever <unk> <unk> that may intimate 
 those people to whom i refer are not some <unk> <unk> quantity they are artists critics taxi drivers <unk> even some employees of the ministry of culture all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the cuban revolution <unk> out in terms such as <unk> among all members of the society <unk> for education and creative expression universal rights to health and <unk> housing etc 
 in fact the generation of <unk> growing into maturity right now works with such <unk> held <unk> assumptions and such <unk> commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes <unk> <unk> 's famous <unk> of art <unk> and revolution seem modest 
 it is on behalf of these people and out of my real respect for them that i am responding to mr. <unk> 's opinions of their country 
 the <unk> trial in july with its <unk> of deeply rooted and widespread corruption and the summary trial and execution was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of cuba 
 however <unk> though those <unk> may have been they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth 
 mr. <unk> should make <unk> among <unk> the army and the cuban people 
 they are not <unk> since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances 
 it is <unk> to <unk> a government 's policies with the will of the people as we well know and it is even worse <unk> to merge the clearly <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the military and the state bureaucracy 
 mr. <unk> is also <unk> that mr. <unk> has resisted collaboration with u.s. officials even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime such as <unk> <unk> 
 i think it 's a little <unk> to be surprised that <unk> does n't <unk> the u.s. state department to violate the jurisdiction of the cuban government over its own territory 
 we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom 
 without this basic level of attention to reality our policies on cuba will continue to be as <unk> as they have for N years 
 from my own point of view given the <unk> of <unk> creativity and warm spirit in which the cuban people <unk> we deny ourselves access to things we hold <unk> and which seem to run in such short supply these days 
 there is no rational <unk> for such behavior 
 <unk> weiss <unk> mass 
 <unk> inc. recently reported third-quarter earnings which were mistakenly shown in the quarterly earnings surprises table in last tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates 
 <unk> investment research did n't adjust one analyst 's estimate for a stock split which therefore was artificially high 
 <unk> 's third-quarter net income of N cents a share actually was N N higher than the adjusted average of estimates 
 investors <unk> out of new york city bonds in <unk> last week driving prices lower and boosting yields 
 one bond trader estimated that more than $ N million of new york city general obligation bonds were put up for sale friday alone 
 while that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding friday 's selling followed a <unk> effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors 
 i 've never seen so many new york city <unk> 's up for sale said another trader 
 every broker has blocks of every size and maturity 
 municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health rumors of a $ N million bond offering coming soon and political uncertainty 
 a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks before the november mayoral election 
 general obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit 
 although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold 
 the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new york 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected 
 new york one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds sold $ N million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago 
 there have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening as the october N stock market crash continues to make itself felt 
 the recent sharp stock market decline <unk> those concerns 
 meanwhile tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding 
 rumors <unk> last week that new york 's credit ratings single-a from moody 's investors service inc. and <unk> from standard & poor 's corp. are at risk 
 the weakness in new york city bonds follows a warning from new york state comptroller edward <unk> that the N crash seriously weakened the city 's economy 
 in a study the comptroller said the city 's glory days are over 
 mr. <unk> warned mayoral candidates to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years due to the <unk> weakening in the new york city economy 
 new york city 's revised financial plan due out later this month is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ N billion budget 
 at present analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ N million to $ N million for the fiscal year ending june N N although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit 
 mark page new york 's deputy director of finance said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves 
 he charges the city 's critics with spreading <unk> emotional rhetoric 
 there are also questions about whether a new and <unk> mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis 
 the leading <unk> for the mayoral office democrat david dinkins has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs 
 and the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election 
 until last week mr. dinkins was considered a <unk> 
 the market can adjust to good news or bad news but uncertainty drives people wild said bernard b. <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> & co. a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market 
 until last week everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election 
 now there have been a number of questions raised 
 last week yields on long-term new york city general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point 
 new york city 's N N bonds due N for example were quoted late friday at a price to yield N N compared with N N thursday 
 as the yield on new york general obligation bonds rose the bond buyer <unk> general obligation index the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market held steady at N N in the week ended oct. N 
 qintex australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los angeles-based affiliate qintex entertainment inc. filed for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 qintex entertainment also said david evans its president and chief executive and roger <unk> a director both resigned 
 neither could be reached for comment 
 earlier this month qintex australia 's $ N billion agreement to acquire mgm\/ua communications co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction 
 mr. evans had been the de <unk> head of mgm\/ua for months 
 qintex entertainment a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its <unk> of the hit <unk> <unk> <unk> said it filed for chapter N protection after qintex australia failed to provide it with $ N million owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of the new leave it to <unk> show 
 qintex entertainment is N N owned by qintex australia and said it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements 
 after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing qintex entertainment stock sank $ N in over-the-counter trading to close at $ N on heavy volume of more than N million shares 
 the stock traded as high as $ N this past summer 
 jonathan lloyd executive vice president and chief financial officer of qintex entertainment said qintex entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with mca 
 the $ N million payment was due oct. N and the deadline for default was oct. N 
 mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ N million in debt under its loan agreements 
 mca on friday said that as a result of qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was <unk> the distribution agreement on the new leave it to <unk> as well as other mca properties 
 qintex australia was saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation 
 they continued to represent that to the board said mr. lloyd 
 we were <unk> they would stand behind the company 
 mr. lloyd said both qintex entertainment and qintex australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ N million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on oct. N 
 at that point he said qintex australia stated it would <unk> to arrange the financing 
 however a qintex australia spokesman said his firm had never promised or guaranteed to make the payment 
 in a prepared statement from australia the company also said that following the breakdown of the mgm talks it had been <unk> its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of qintex entertainment and had resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to qintex entertainment in excess of that previously made 
 the qintex australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter N filing 
 he said the company believed qintex entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means 
 the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors 
 it 's a <unk> said joseph di <unk> chairman of <unk> capital securities a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment 
 qintex australia was going to pay more than $ N billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ N million 
 qintex said mr. evans the former president resigned for personal reasons and that mr. <unk> an attorney resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no longer necessary 
 mr. <unk> was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since N 
 the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between qintex australia and mgm\/ua might be revived 
 it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested 
 however we are n't currently doing anything 
 it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company said barry <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp 
 financial printer <unk> & co. said it formed a business translation service which will provide legal financial and other services in most major <unk> including japanese chinese and russian 
 japan 's finance ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new york <unk> free fall 
 <unk> utsumi vice minister for international affairs said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the ual corp. leveraged buy-out 
 the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general mr. utsumi said 
 there are no facts behind the <unk> that we sent any kind of signal he declared in an interview 
 the comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets 
 a number of accounts of the events leading to the N point drop in new york stock prices on oct. N accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the ual deal for one reason or another 
 mr. utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous u.s. leveraged buy-out 
 the ministry <unk> about that deal which mr. utsumi declined to identify because the large presence of japanese banks in the deal was being strongly criticized in the u.s. congress and it was necessary for us to grasp the situation 
 he said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation and he added that none of the japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry 
 mr. utsumi also said some japanese banks were willing to participate in the ual financing up to the very end which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out 
 in general mr. utsumi said japanese banks are becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals 
 each japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that ual deal he said 
 they are becoming more independent 
 it 's a sound phenomenon 
 <unk> bank ltd. is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first ual proposal 
 a <unk> bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision 
 we made our own decision he said 
 still mr. utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have <unk> or <unk> believed that the ministry played a role in <unk> recent moves by japanese banks 
 all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position 
 bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads 
 the ministry thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing that they have very little idea how to cope with risk said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified 
 the ministry wants to see the japanese banks pull in their <unk> on leveraged buy-outs he added 
 although some of the japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for ual bowed out because they found the terms <unk> observers here say they have a hard time <unk> that commercial considerations were the only reason 
 japanese banks are under political pressure as well the analyst said 
 moreover analysts point out that japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats 
 clearly some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs 
 at a news conference this week bank of japan gov. <unk> <unk> cautioned banks to take a prudent stance regarding highly leveraged deals 
 despite mr. <unk> 's statements it is the finance ministry not the central bank that makes policy decisions 
 while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game 
 despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market bank analysts say 
 flush with cash at home but with fewer customers to lend to leading banks are eager to expand overseas 
 jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to <unk> the problem of not having a strong <unk> network 
 france 's national tobacco company known for making <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> and <unk> is <unk> out 
 concerned by <unk> demand for its traditional products it is moving not only into <unk> cigarettes but also into electronic <unk> payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores 
 brown tobacco in france is a more <unk> stronger grade than the lighter grade or <unk> tobacco used in so-called <unk> cigarettes 
 we are n't philip morris cos. says <unk> de <unk> chairman of government-owned societe <unk> <unk> <unk> des <unk> & <unk> s.a. known as seita 
 he says that because seita 's profits are limited by <unk> cigarette prices he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the u.s. concern has done 
 last year for example seita 's net profit soared N N to N million french francs $ N million on sales of <unk> N billion a N N profit margin 
 instead he said in an interview he is looking for ways to exploit france 's network of N tobacco agents most of them <unk> 
 while seita does n't own the french <unk> its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities 
 one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in paris 
 instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines which deliver little paper receipts drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops 
 once <unk> the card would sit in the car 's window showing traffic <unk> how much time the <unk> could remain 
 when the <unk> returned to his car he could turn the card off and if it showed time remaining save it for later 
 seita is a partner in the project which was developed by <unk> <unk> using japanese technology 
 seita and <unk> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service 
 and seita is considering further diversification 
 it wanted to buy rjr nabisco inc. 's french <unk> subsidiary <unk> in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores but lost the bidding to food group bsn <unk> 
 it currently is considering bidding for swedish match co 
 and it retains an interest in acquiring <unk> and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops 
 it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business 
 <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> now make up just N N of the french tobacco market half the level of about two decades ago 
 while seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in france it is being hurt by rising imports and from <unk> cigarette demand 
 so seita has introduced <unk> cigarettes under the <unk> label and intends to <unk> the unsuccessful <unk> <unk> in new packaging similar to the <unk> used by <unk> <unk> 
 the aim says mr. de <unk> is to win market share from imported cigarettes and to persuade smokers who are switching to <unk> cigarettes to keep buying french 
 when the supreme court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions last july the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving <unk> and false <unk> on their minds 
 but the N ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities especially <unk> as on abortion rights 
 the decision webster vs. reproductive health services illustrates how supreme court rulings often have a <unk> effect spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices 
 in the missouri case <unk> consequences may have <unk> because the high court <unk> the preamble of the state 's N abortion law 
 the preamble says that human life begins at conception and that <unk> children have rights protected by the constitution 
 last year a federal appeals court in st. louis said the preamble was unconstitutional citing an earlier supreme court ruling that states ca n't justify <unk> abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins 
 but the supreme court concluded that it was <unk> to rule on the <unk> of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services 
 the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws 
 already local missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to reproductive health services an abortion clinic in st. louis 
 the protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of <unk> children 
 under a N missouri law persons accused of some crimes including <unk> may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury 
 relying on the preamble 's statement that a <unk> is an <unk> child the two st. louis county circuit court judges in august accepted the <unk> that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives 
 in another case a <unk> ann o'brien was convicted of trespass before the supreme court 's webster ruling 
 last week when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals her lawyer also relied on the preamble 
 the effect of the supreme court webster opinion is that it left room for <unk> to grow in the cracks of roe vs. wade and i think this is one of the cracks said mark <unk> a st. louis lawyer who represented ms. o'brien and the other st. louis protesters 
 roe vs. wade was the supreme court 's N decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion 
 mario <unk> president of kansas city lawyers for life says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass this will shut down abortion in missouri 
 there 's no risk to the protesters and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are N people standing outside every day 
 that would be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme court <unk> stopped short of <unk> roe vs. wade 
 in two other cases the possible consequences of the supreme court ruling appear even more <unk> 
 in one the lawyer for a <unk> resident of columbia mo. who was charged with drunk driving argued that his client should be treated as a <unk> adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception not from birth 
 in missouri those caught drinking and driving between the ages of N and N may have their licenses <unk> for one year while those N or older suffer only a 30-day suspension 
 a boone county judge rejected the motion but daniel <unk> a jefferson city lawyer says he has appealed 
 and in a case filed in federal court in august a lawyer is arguing that missouri authorities are <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and <unk> 
 in terms of sheer <unk> the <unk> regime of <unk> barre may rank as no. N in the world 
 the only reason that somalia remains in <unk> is numbers a <unk> <unk> <unk> of N million people spread out over an <unk> nearly the size of texas 
 the barre <unk> simply is limited in the amount of people it can <unk> and kill 
 <unk> small children <unk> elderly people to death <unk> and shooting women and <unk> people alive are just a few of the <unk> activities that the <unk> armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years 
 up to N <unk> have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre 's troops 
 in the port of <unk> for example hundreds of men of the rival <unk> <unk> were <unk> up in may N <unk> and then taken out at night in groups of five to N men to be executed without any judicial process <unk> 
 guns were never used each man was <unk> to death with a large <unk> 
 the <unk> details are only now emerging from a <unk> <unk> report based on hundreds of interviews with <unk> selected refugees 
 the study was done by robert <unk> a consultant to the u.s. state department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the <unk> ideological divide 
 what gives these events particular significance however is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet union on the horn of africa 
 not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for <unk> as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks 
 mr. barre 's rule is crumbling fast 
 <unk> <unk> his armed forces really just an armed gang which control less than half the country 
 inflation is at record levels 
 desperate he has called in the <unk> to help fight the rebels of the <unk> national movement in the north which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <unk> 
 <unk> years old and a <unk> scientific socialist president barre has a power base composed only of his minority <unk> <unk> that according to observers is narrowing 
 the u.s. 's interest in somalia consists of a single runway at the port of <unk> which u.s. military aircraft have the right to use for <unk> of the gulf of <unk> and the indian ocean 
 that strip of concrete is backed up by a few <unk> <unk> <unk> where a handful of american <unk> <unk> by imported food cold soft drinks and back issues of sports illustrated maintain radio contact with the outside world 
 in the past two years the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and <unk> <unk> where due to mr. barre 's <unk> and <unk> nobody is any longer in control 
 as long as the rival <unk> regime of mengistu <unk> <unk> held a total gridlock over neighboring ethiopia the u.s. was forced to accept that <unk> <unk> runway as a distant no. N to the soviets ' array of <unk> next door 
 but due to dramatic events on the <unk> over the past few days and weeks those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as <unk> as the american runway 
 on sept. N i wrote on these pages about the killing and <unk> of N <unk> soldiers by <unk> and <unk> guerrillas 
 recently in <unk> province in the center of ethiopia <unk> forces have killed <unk> and captured an additional N government troops 
 think what these numbers mean considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in lebanon a small country of little strategic importance 
 <unk> <unk> are now N miles north of <unk> <unk> threatening the town of <unk> which would cut off mr. mengistu 's capital from the port of <unk> through which all fuel and other supplies reach <unk> <unk> 
 as a result mr. mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <unk> just to hold the town thereby <unk> the loss of even more territory in <unk> only to keep the <unk> at bay 
 mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position half his army is tied down defending the northern city of <unk> from the <unk> 
 the weaker he gets the more he turns toward the u.s. for help 
 while the <unk> are communists like the <unk> they are among the most <unk> guerrillas in the world having suffered more than a decade of <unk> <unk> by the <unk> mengistu air force 
 what this all means in <unk> is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is <unk> as fast as president barre 's regime in somalia is 
 the u.s. therefore has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in somalia and to undo the <unk> <unk> of the late 1970s on the horn of africa 
 back to somalia 
 the state department to its credit has already begun <unk> itself from mr. barre <unk> by its decision to publish the <unk> report which the press has ignored 
 what 's more the u.s. has suspended $ N million in military aid and $ N million in economic aid 
 but this is not enough 
 because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he goes the runway could go too 
 considering how <unk> the security of that runway is anyway the better option both morally and <unk> would be for the bush administration to blast the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all influential <unk> to understand 
 it is a <unk> that mr. barre 's days are numbered 
 the u.s. should take care however that its own position in the country does not go down with him 
 nobody is sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might be 
 but as one expert tells me whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre 
 while the state department positions itself for the <unk> period in somalia it should continue to back former president carter 's <unk> role as a mediator between mr. mengistu and the <unk> guerrillas in ethiopia while <unk> opening up channels of communications with the <unk> rebels through neighboring <unk> 
 <unk> politics are the most sophisticated <unk> and <unk> in all of black africa 
 remember that it took mr. mengistu many months in what became known as the creeping coup to topple <unk> <unk> <unk> in N and N 
 there is simply no way to engineer a succession <unk> as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent 
 but the u.s. has one great advantage the soviets are <unk> <unk> throughout ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade <unk> and all 
 it 's not just in eastern europe where the march of events is finally on the u.s. side but on the horn of africa as well 
 the only u.s. liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr. barre and that should be cut fast 
 mr. <unk> author of surrender or <unk> the wars behind the <unk> <unk> press N lives in <unk> 
 <unk> inc. <unk> <unk> calif. got an $ N million navy contract for <unk> systems 
 general electric co. received a $ N million air force contract for <unk> nose <unk> 
 goodyear tire & rubber co. was awarded a $ N million army contract for <unk> parts

 mccormick is a developer and manager of <unk> limited partnerships 
 through a separate agreement between peter <unk> president and a group of selling shareholders the company said mr. <unk> will on oct. N buy N shares from the group boosting his stake to about N shares or N N of the total after the buy-back

 opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets 
 output from the organization of petroleum exporting countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out 
 but industry and opec officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to <unk> the market and cause an <unk> collapse a few months from now if opec does n't soon adopt a new quota system to <unk> its <unk> <unk> 
 as a result the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent <unk> agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency 
 the organization is scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov. N 
 so far this year rising demand for opec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others 
 but that could change if demand for opec 's oil <unk> seasonally early next year as some think may happen 
 opec is currently producing more than N million barrels a day sharply above its nominal <unk> fourth-quarter ceiling of N million according to opec and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the oil daily and the international herald tribune 
 at that rate a majority of opec 's N members have reached their output limits they said 
 but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of spare capacity still exists within opec 
 most is concentrated in five persian gulf countries including his own <unk> <unk> <unk> 's oil minister told the conference friday 
 he puts opec 's current capacity at N million to N million barrels a day 
 that 's higher than some other estimates 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> kuwait 's oil minister recently estimated opec capacity at N million barrels a day 
 either way the <unk> is big enough to keep <unk> balanced oil markets on edge 
 even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as saudi arabia and <unk> could upset the market 
 the <unk> oil minister and saudi oil minister <unk> <unk> insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act <unk> to maintain a stable market 
 however in interviews later both ministers stressed that they expect future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member 
 under that approach countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system 
 if you are already producing at N N or N N of your capacity what 's the good to be told you can produce at N N of capacity asked mr. <unk> 
 at an <unk> geneva meeting late last month opec 's oil ministers <unk> approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling 
 they <unk> it out using the existing formula however which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official <unk> 
 the main effect of the ceiling boost was to <unk> some of the <unk> already coming from the quota <unk> 
 still there was a <unk> at geneva 
 previously no opec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target or ceiling 
 but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity advanced there in an iranian proposal was generally endorsed by the ministers 
 in the end politics got in the way 
 libya accepted iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with kuwait 
 and the united arab <unk> a <unk> quota <unk> refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways 
 but the oil ministers continue to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting 
 it 's understood several <unk> already have been worked into the plan 
 the ceiling would be lifted to N million barrels to provide kuwait and the united arab <unk> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others 
 libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem although the united arab <unk> is still an issue 
 saudi arabia opec 's <unk> also has surfaced as a possible obstacle some opec sources said 
 insisting on a N N share of any ceiling saudi officials have long pressed for the pro <unk> distribution of increases to all members 
 in geneva however they supported iran 's proposal because it would have left the saudi percentage of the opec total intact and increased actual saudi volume to nearly N million barrels daily from five million 
 some of the proposed modifications since however call on saudi arabia to give back to the <unk> pool a <unk> N barrels 
 though tiny that 's a reduction in its share 
 mr. <unk> the saudi oil minister reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of opec production under any quota revisions 
 under any circumstances saudi arabia should get more rather than less mr. <unk> said 
 in a blow to france 's rafale jet fighter the french navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy N mcdonnell douglas corp. <unk> <unk> to defend its aircraft carriers 
 the statement is likely to <unk> the debate within france 's military establishment over the rafale which is made by <unk> <unk> <unk> aviation <unk> 
 in an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine <unk> <unk> the navy 's <unk> adm. <unk> goupil said the navy still intends to buy N <unk> as scheduled in the late 1990s and early <unk> century 
 the air force is to take at least N more 
 adm. goupil said the navy ca n't wait until N when the naval rafale becomes available to replace its <unk> fleet of <unk> crusaders used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack 
 rather than <unk> the crusaders which dassault is proposing to do for around N billion french francs $ N million adm. goupil said the navy wants to buy used <unk> from the u.s. navy 
 officially the statement is n't an attack on the rafale 
 adm. goupil said that when the <unk> wear out the navy is prepared to take <unk> to replace them 
 but <unk> senior navy officials sharply <unk> the rafale as an air force plane <unk> to carrier use 
 although they never said so publicly they have made no secret of their preference for the <unk> on operational grounds 
 adm. goupil 's comments are likely to <unk> the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of dassault 
 although <unk> dassault still is run by the founder 's son chairman <unk> dassault who has fiercely protected his company 's independence 
 the rafale project is the result of france 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries and french officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs 
 so far mr. dassault has resisted pressure to change 
 what brought the naval issue to a head is that the crusaders are literally falling apart without any immediate plan to replace them 
 adm. goupil a former <unk> <unk> leader said that the last other country to use crusaders the philippines retired its last ones two years ago 
 a french <unk> crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here 
 adm. goupil rejected dassault 's proposal to <unk> the crusaders saying the cost was impossible to estimate 
 even <unk> he said the crusaders represent an <unk> and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers france has sent to meet such crises as the wars in lebanon and the persian gulf 
 defense minister <unk> <unk> told a meeting of the <unk> press association that the question of <unk> the crusaders or buying used <unk> is a political decision that he will make in due time

 for cathay pacific airways the smooth ride may be ending 
 the first signs of trouble came last month when the hong kong carrier a subsidiary of <unk> pacific ltd. posted a N N drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year 
 securities analysts many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing cathay 's interim figures believe more <unk> lie ahead 
 fuel and personnel costs are rising and tourism in and through hong kong remains <unk> by china 's turmoil since the june N killings in beijing 
 in addition delivery delays for the first two of as many as N boeing <unk> that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes 
 and tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline 
 there also is concern that once hong kong <unk> to china 's sovereignty in N cathay will be forced to play second <unk> to china 's <unk> flag carrier civil aviation administration of china or <unk> 
 the sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before says rod eddington cathay 's commercial director 
 <unk> hall an analyst at james capel far east ltd. says there is n't much cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel hong kong 's tight labor market or the strengthening of the local currency which is pegged to the u.s. dollar 
 these factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one ms. hall says 
 ms. hall expects cathay 's profit to grow around N N annually this year and next 
 in N it earned $ N billion hong kong us$ N million on revenue of hk$ N billion 
 cathay is taking several steps to bolster business 
 one step is to beef up its fleet 
 in addition to aircraft from boeing co. cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as N airbus <unk> 
 the expansion which could cost as much as us$ N billion over the next eight years will expand the fleet to about N planes by N up from N at the end of last year according to sun hung <unk> securities ltd 
 the <unk> airbus planes will be used largely to replace cathay 's aging fleet of lockheed <unk> for regional flights while the boeing aircraft will be used on <unk> routes to europe and north america 
 cathay also is moving some of its <unk> <unk> operations outside hong kong 
 fierce bidding for young employees in hong kong is pushing up cathay 's labor costs by N N a year for <unk> staff while experienced skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain 
 some jobs already have been moved to australia and there are plans to place others in canada 
 david bell a spokesman for the airline says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign <unk> ahead of N 
 cathay is working to promote hong kong as a <unk> worth visiting on its own merits rather than just a <unk> 
 although the june N killings in beijing have hurt its china flights cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors 
 mr. eddington <unk> promoting hong kong as an important part of attracting visitors from japan south korea and taiwan where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged 
 there also has been speculation that cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the hong kong government 's plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal 
 cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation 
 mr. eddington sees alliances with other carriers particularly cathay 's recent link with amr corp. 's american airlines as an important part of cathay 's strategy 
 but he <unk> that cathay has n't any interest in <unk> equity stakes with the u.s. carrier or with lufthansa the west german airline with which it has <unk> for about a decade 
 analysts believe cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among european carriers 
 we think alliances are very important mr. eddington says 
 but we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's 
 i 'm not sure <unk> would necessarily make things <unk> 
 in a pattern it aims to copy in several key u.s. <unk> cathay recently announced plans to serve san francisco by flying into american airlines ' los angeles hub and <unk> continuing passengers onto a flight on the u.s. carrier 
 we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. and they 'll never have one as big as us in the pacific mr. eddington says 
 but this way american will coordinate good <unk> to boston new york chicago and dallas 
 we 'll coordinate on this end to places like <unk> singapore and manila 
 asian traffic which currently accounts for N N of cathay 's business is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay 
 cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to N and it is applying to <unk> <unk> flights into vietnam 
 further expansion into southern europe is also possible says mr. bell the spokesman 
 while a large number of hong kong companies have <unk> offshore ahead of N such a move is n't an option for cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in hong kong 
 and mr. eddington <unk> rules out a move to london our <unk> is hong kong traffic rights 
 he says the airline is putting its faith in the <unk> agreement on hong kong 's return to china 
 a special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for hong kong 's airlines which include the smaller hong kong <unk> airlines will continue to be negotiated by hong kong 's government 
 but critics <unk> that <unk> officials ultimately will be responsible to beijing 
 my feeling is cathay does n't have a hope in the long run says an analyst who declines to be identified 
 cathay would love to keep going but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something 
 mr. eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to <unk> and <unk> to local changes but he feels that the <unk> agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future 
 we 're confident that it protects our route structure he says and our ability to grow and <unk>

 a young woman who has been out of town shows up at the marina middle school to learn that her apartment is on the <unk> list 
 she is told she ca n't enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector 
 she bursts into <unk> and walks away 
 nearby five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on <unk> having their <unk> and backs <unk> by volunteer <unk> 
 the marina rescue center offered a very san <unk> response to the disaster 
 in addition to free massages there was free counseling phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club which offered up its <unk> <unk> and hot <unk> 
 the cafeteria offered donated <unk> and <unk> for breakfast and for dinner pasta <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> along with the <unk> 
 this has been a <unk> earthquake for me said resident joan <unk> who works in an <unk> 's office 
 she and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free <unk> classes and <unk> therapy massages with <unk> oils 
 she finds the response of marina residents primarily <unk> and elderly people to the devastation of their homes incredible 
 people have been very <unk> of each other 
 i do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else 
 out on the streets some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a <unk> <unk> hunt through their <unk>

 the marina also has become the <unk> point of city efforts to <unk> residents with any <unk> that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake 
 on <unk> along <unk> street a major marina artery <unk> were offering a $ N reward for a cat lost during the quake 
 the san francisco society for the prevention of <unk> to animals also has been providing medical care food water and foster homes for <unk> animals 
 the <unk> says it has received more than N requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and <unk> though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish 
 for example one <unk> owner returning home found that her apartment like many others in the marina did n't have heat

 the neighborhood around alexander <unk> co. 's vermont-slauson shopping center in the watts section of los angeles resembles the <unk> deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit 
 but turn into the shopping center 's parking lot and one could be in the safe busy mall of a <unk> suburb 
 only it is safer and <unk> 
 over the past year there have been only one <unk> three <unk> of or from autos no <unk> and one attempted <unk> in the mall which opened in late N 
 a shopping center of similar size in an affluent los angeles suburb would per year be expected to have eight <unk> N <unk> of or from autos and four <unk> 
 the watts mall has annual sales of more than $ N per <unk> square foot the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ N 
 three other <unk> shopping centers in the watts area are doing almost as well 
 a successful <unk> mall in a <unk> area violates the more typical inner-city pattern in which commercial areas are taken over by <unk> youth gangs and the criminal element with an erosion of the customer base development capital and <unk> 
 major regional and national chain stores are replaced by <unk> operations offering <unk> merchandise at higher prices 
 along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents 
 thus there is even more to the vermont-slauson center than a good place to shop 
 this <unk> commercial zone becomes for the residents a secure <unk> in a <unk> urban landscape evidence that community <unk> is not inevitable and that the gangs are not <unk> 
 the center improves the community image to outsiders as well and may help to arrest or even reverse the exodus of capital and investment 
 an additional benefit is the creation of jobs 
 this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers 
 it continues through the life of the center the vermont-slauson center has created N permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ N per job 
 as many of these jobs are filled by local residents who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls the $ <unk> public investment should repay itself in a few years 
 and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales real estate licenses and the like 
 profits are also <unk> back into the community the <unk> vermont-slauson economic development corp. receives N N of the profits from the vermont-slauson center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community now running into the hundreds of units as well as commercial and industrial development projects 
 bradford <unk> director of the mayor 's city economic development office says there is no question that vermont-slauson had a <unk> effect on the surrounding neighborhood 
 what had been a deteriorated area with nothing but <unk> shops and <unk> shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock thanks to a <unk> <unk> source of <unk> capital that vermont-slauson yields 
 another benefit is that substantial <unk> of the <unk> in these centers are minority businessmen and women 
 in the grand <unk> plaza developed by <unk> realty group in chicago 's third ward opposite the robert taylor homes N N of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and N N to members of other minority groups 
 children from the community will have <unk> role models than the drug <unk> 
 so what 's the catch 
 primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time patience <unk> of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers <unk> 
 security costs are also quite high 
 one of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies local political leaders and citizen groups and with prospective tenants and sources of financing 
 suburban deals are not without their delays and <unk> inner-city deals just have more of them 
 security at a typical <unk> inner-city center is impressive but <unk> 
 the entire site is <unk> by a <unk> <unk> iron <unk> with a small number of <unk> gates 
 <unk> and flowers give it a <unk> and <unk> appearance 
 <unk> motion detectors and <unk> tv cameras monitor the entire center lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard 
 the security command post <unk> as <unk> retail space has its own <unk> 's <unk> above the <unk> of the other buildings with a <unk> view of the entire center 
 local law enforcement is present in a <unk> <unk> space donated by the center 
 these features are also used in <unk> realty group 's grand <unk> plaza 
 <unk> has its own large security force of <unk> and <unk> personnel on <unk> duty at each center 
 security is N N to N N of the common area charges of these centers vs. an industry average of about N N 
 these security costs are kept <unk> because the centers ' site acquisition construction and financing costs were reduced by such programs as urban development action grants economic development administration grants community development block grants tax-free industrial development bonds enterprise zone tax write-offs city infrastructure grants and tax <unk> financing 
 many of these programs no longer exist or have been severely cut back 
 however since these centers appear to pay for themselves there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from <unk> legislation with similar provisions 
 many states already have enterprise zones and legislation that combines tax incentives loans and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the <unk> and minorities 
 these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning identifying sources of funds and for acquiring a site and preparing it 
 <unk> crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date 
 with many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers inner-city areas may represent a major new <unk> market for investment 
 new approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets 
 if the risks and rewards are reasonable developers will respond 
 government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit vermont-slauson and grand <unk> plaza and decide for themselves 
 the answer will be obvious

 some stock pickers already are targeting the otc market where they say await plenty of small and medium-sized growth stocks 
 best of all they add these growth issues unlike their big blue-chip <unk> on the new york stock exchange are <unk> at depressed prices 
 growth stocks will return to favor some analysts and money managers think because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on oct. N and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements 
 against such a backdrop companies with proven track records of earnings gains of N N or so annually have extra appeal 
 the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth declares mary farrell a painewebber analyst 
 among her otc picks are <unk> <unk> and <unk> brands 
 like many otc growth issues they have market values as measured by stock price times shares outstanding of roughly $ N million to $ N million 
 some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long 
 these are sometimes dubbed emerging growth companies though they also have <unk> track records 
 while many growth stocks are small not all small stocks have <unk> momentum 
 that 's an important <unk> because some analysts and brokers who <unk> predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues may use any <unk> in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks

 <unk> smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently 
 the average issue on standard & poor 's 500-stock index gained N N last year ms. farrell of painewebber says 
 <unk> earnings by comparison rose between N N and N N 
 in addition earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow restructuring and takeover potential and breakup value as the preferred <unk> standards for much of the year 
 also the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips 
 as a result morgan stanley 's index of N emerging growth stocks most of which are in the otc market is up only N N for the year while the dow jones industrial average has leaped N N and the s&p N has grown N N

 for bankers and regulators arizona is looking more like texas every day 
 on friday los angeles-based first interstate bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ N million for the third quarter of N because of hemorrhaging at its first interstate bank of arizona unit 
 first interstate said the unit <unk> by arizona 's worsening real-estate woes will have a $ N million loss for the quarter 
 first interstate took a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank 
 it charged off an estimated $ N million of arizona loans leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ N million about N N of its $ N million of troubled loans and <unk> real estate 
 first interstate made the move under pressure from regulators 
 the action capped a <unk> of grim arizona banking news for the third quarter and <unk> signaled that arizona is challenging texas 's long <unk> as banking 's busiest <unk> 
 earlier last week valley national corp. the state 's largest locally owned banking company reported a $ N million loss and suspended its dividend 
 pinnacle west capital corp. which has been <unk> with regulators for months over what to do about pinnacle 's <unk> merabank thrift unit suspended its dividend and reported a N N plunge in third-quarter net income 
 security pacific corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ N million mainly because of sour arizona real-estate loans 
 new york-based chase manhattan corp. took an $ N million <unk> charge 
 furthermore the regulatory <unk> behind first interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it 
 <unk> from the office of the comptroller of the currency had been <unk> through first interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month they first recommended that first interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ N million third-quarter hit 
 when first interstate balked arguing that the figure was too high regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ N million 
 at that point first interstate decided it was the better part of <unk> not to negotiate further said one industry official close to the talks 
 thomas p. <unk> chief financial officer would n't comment about the details of the negotiations 
 he said the provision was n't forced upon us but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number 
 the tough regulatory stance <unk> large future losses especially at the state 's thrifts 
 at least six of arizona 's N savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent they are sitting on enormous <unk> losses 
 for example western savings & loan association which is now in conservatorship had tangible <unk> minus liabilities of a negative $ N million at june N 
 it had a $ N million loss in the second quarter 
 yet it still held $ N million of <unk> real estate for which it maintains no reserves <unk> 
 it also had $ N million of <unk> loans its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available though it is believed to be small 
 the rapid deterioration of the arizona thrifts only adds to the <unk> cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout officially estimated at about $ N billion 
 together the six <unk> or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ N billion foreclosed property of $ N billion and <unk> loans of $ N billion 
 they have no reserves against the real estate and their reserves against the loans are <unk> compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up 
 the thrifts had a combined loss of $ N million in the second quarter 
 other lenders have been recovering only N cents to N cents on the dollar on foreclosed arizona property if they can sell it at all 
 all this havoc is the result of one of the worst <unk> in arizona 's <unk> history compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking <unk> greed fraud and plain bad banking 
 in the late 1970s and early 1980s lenders and developers poured money into office buildings <unk> and massive <unk> of raw desert land confident that arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of N N to N N for years to come 
 now annual population growth is running at about N N a year some desert <unk> bought three years ago for $ N an <unk> are being sold at $ N an <unk> and phoenix has a seven-year supply of <unk> office space 
 it 's horrible to say but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in phoenix it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings said <unk> jackson a prominent arizona businessman with interests in real estate banking and many other businesses 
 many arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come 
 ralph <unk> publisher of <unk> update newsletter said <unk> have climbed to about N a month just in <unk> county where phoenix is located 
 that 's up from about N a month in N and it 's accelerating so far this month <unk> are averaging about N a day 
 it 's <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 moreover mr. <unk> and others said residential real estate which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn is beginning to <unk> more and more of the <unk> 
 and the generally <unk> condition of arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide 
 it 's reasonable to say there is not a <unk> s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low said mr. jackson 
 we 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end 
 the only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is pay me in N days 
 first interstate had a $ N million loss in N 's third quarter mainly from <unk> and reserves connected with its texas operations 
 for the six months ended june N it reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share including $ N million from tax credits and accounting changes 
 the bank 's arizona unit holds about $ N billion of first interstate 's $ N billion of assets 
 mr. <unk> said the bank expects arizona real-estate prices which plummeted N N over the last year to fall another N N before stabilizing 
 some in arizona think that may be optimistic 
 first interstate said its operations outside of arizona achieved results as expected for the quarter but did n't specify the results 
 first interstate stock closed at $ N down N cents in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange 
 since its unsuccessful bid for bankamerica corp. in N the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance but many industry officials believe it may be <unk> for a takeover bid especially with interstate banking set to begin in california in N 
 mr. <unk> said the problems in arizona have only increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective 
 separately standard & poor 's corp. lowered its ratings on valley national corp. 's senior debt to <unk> from <unk> affecting about $ N million of long-term debt 
 s&p also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit valley national bank of arizona 
 the ratings service said the <unk> reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition 
 a spokesman for phoenix <unk> valley national said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in arizona real estate 
 commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds he said and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days 
 <unk> corp. said its scientists isolated a <unk> which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the <unk> ranging from <unk> rejection to <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> is the mouse version of a protein called the <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> is a <unk> which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response 
 the <unk> <unk> on the surface of such cells receives the <unk> 's message to rally the body 's defense 
 but in certain conditions such as <unk> diseases and <unk> and transplant rejection doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful <unk> reactions or cell destruction 
 a <unk> form of the <unk> might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune <unk> the company said 
 the <unk> <unk> is one of five such <unk> to be developed and tested by <unk> corp. a spinoff of <unk> through a proposed $ N million initial public offering 
 <unk> will contract with the spinoff to provide the research development and initial testing of the new agents 
 <unk> will have the option to buy back <unk> shares after five years

 conner peripherals inc. which has a <unk> on a key part used in many portable computers is on target to <unk> compaq computer corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in u.s. business history 
 conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers 
 it said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-ago period 
 its revenue totaled $ N million an increase of N N from $ N million a year ago 
 for the nine months the san jose calif.-based company said net income jumped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue nearly tripled to $ N million from $ N million 
 analysts expect conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ N million or $ N to $ N a share on sales of $ N million for N the company 's third full year in business 
 that 's a faster growth rate than reported by compaq which did n't post similar results until its fourth year in N 
 but compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up 
 conner 's performance is closely tied to the <unk> demand for <unk> computers the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment 
 since its inception conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to N times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines 
 today conner controls an estimated N N of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers 
 the company supplies drives to compaq and zenith data systems the top two u.s. manufacturers of <unk> and to toshiba corp. nec corp. and sharp corp. the leading japanese laptop makers 
 they 've had this field to themselves for over a year now and they 've been greatly <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst at <unk> inc. a market researcher in los <unk> calif 
 in the coming months however this is likely to change 
 next month seagate technology which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers plans to introduce its first family of <unk> drives for <unk> computers 
 and the japanese are likely to keep close on conner 's heels 
 they are going to catch up said david <unk> an analyst with hambrecht & quist 
 both toshiba and nec already produce hard-disk drives and sony also is studying the field mr. <unk> said 
 but conner is n't standing still 
 yesterday the company introduced four products three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called <unk> 
 each of the three drives uses a mere N watts of power and one <unk> just N ounces 
 most of our competitors are announcing products based on our older products said <unk> conner chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name 
 we continue to develop products faster than anyone else can 
 these new products could account for as much as N N of the company 's business in N mr. conner estimated 
 we 're not afraid of <unk> some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition he said 
 conner already is shipping its new drives 
 last week for instance compaq introduced its first notebook computer to <unk> reviews 
 conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine which <unk> only six pounds and fits in a <unk> 
 from its inception conner has targeted the market for <unk> machines building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as seagate 
 the availability of these drives in turn boosted demand for laptop computers whose <unk> had been limited because of lack of storage 
 conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to compaq which as of july owned N N of conner 's stock 
 sales to compaq represented N N of conner 's business in its third quarter compared with N N in the year-ago period
